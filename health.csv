"Why You Should Start Peeing On Yourself In The Shower - Health - Nairaland";"Nazae";"Whether we admit it or not, everyone has peed on themselves while having a bath. Though it is our body's waste product some of us don't know is that it actually has a lot of benefits. Below are some of its benefits:1. The most important reason why you should pee on yourself in the shower is that it saves water. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a standard toilet uses 1.6 gallons (6.05 litres) per flush and considering that an average person uses the toilet 6-8 times a day, that is a lot of wasted water. 2. Fascia specialist Lauren Roxburgh recommended women to squat and pee in the shower to engage pelvic floor muscles which can actually lead to better sex. This also applies to men as it improves blood flow in that area and also improve urinary control. 3. Another reason is prevent or treat Athlete's foot (foot fungus). Urea the nitrogenous compound found in your urine is present in some anti-fungal creams. Urea is only present in urine in small amounts so you have to pee a lot to start getting results.Urine can also be used to decrease the symptoms of psoriasis, eczema, acne(applying it on the body), can also be used for rehydration (drinking it).";" 104 ";"Nazae"
"How Can I Get Rid Of Pimples, Dark Spots On My Face?  - Health - Nairaland";"zoho23";"Good evening everyone. How can I achieve a smooth face? I have pimples and dark spotsPicture below";" 27040 ";"zoho23"
"Simple Acne Treatments  To Get Rid Of Pimples On Your Face - Health - Nairaland";"Codedrock";"1. Keep your hands off your face!All dermatologists agree that you should never, ever pick at your pimple. We repeat: Do not pick at your pimple. “It may seem tempting, but remember that once you’ve picked at an acne lesion, it will take longer to heal and is more likely to scar,” warns dermatologist Dr. Doris Day, author of 100 Questions and Answers About Acne. Trust us on this one.2. Skip home “remedies.”While toothpaste, lemon juice, and even Windex have been cited as excellent at-home remedies for blemishes, derms advise against them. “Toothpaste is more complicated than it used to be and can irritate or over-dry your skin,” warns Dr. Day. “Lemon juice is also irritating and wouldn’t have any effect on the pimple itself.” And Windex — well, it’s glass cleaner. Don’t put glass cleaner on your face.3. Apply a warm compress.Heat is a super simple way to soothe your skin if you feel a blemish coming on, says Dr. Margarita Lolis, dermatologist at Skin and Laser Surgery Specialists of New York and New Jersey. “Use a warm compress or steam to bring everything to the surface,” she explains. And once your pimple appears, apply a spot treatment. Alternately, you can use a cold compress to bring down the swelling of a particularly large, painful blemish.4. Use an acne spot treatment.On top of always washing off your makeup at night, using the right moisturizer for your skin type, and keeping your fingers away from your face, you can use a spot treatment to get rid of stubborn pimples. Ingredients to look out for: Benzoyl peroxide to kill acne-causing bacteria, salicylic acid to help exfoliate and unclog pores, and retinoids to help control cell turnover, which allows clogged cells to shed and prevents them from clogging.5. Wash your face regularly.“Your oil glands are active all day,” explains Dr. Joshua Zeichner, Director of Cosmetic & Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital; when that oil combines with dirt, makeup, and pollution, it’s not doing your skin any favors. Amapiano 2020That goes double for workouts: “Sweat mixed with dirt and oil can become trapped under wet workout clothing,” potentially worsening a breakout. “If you can’t take a full shower,” Dr. Zeichner says, “at least use a cleansing towelette,” like Good Housekeeping Beauty Breakthrough Award winner and Seal-holder, Olay Daily Facials.6. In a pinch, get a cortisone shot.Have a really big event coming up? Then, you probably don’t have time to wait and see if your blemish will disappear on its own. Consider seeing a dermatologist for an overnight cure. “A cortisone shot is an anti-inflammatory, so it treats the pimple itself,” explains Dr. Peredo.“If it’s a big, painful pimple, the cortisone diffuses the inflammation and flattens it out, hopefully without leaving a scar.” Of course, this isn’t an easy, at-home DIY fix. It should only be administered by a physician, usually a dermatologist, and it is often covered by insurance if you have acne.7. Try a salicylic acid cleanser.If your breakouts are frequent and you’re sick of it, you may want to consider switching up your skincare routine. “Pick a cleanser that has glycolic or salicylic acid in it, which you can get over the counter,” Dr. Peredo instructs. “Those with acne-prone skin may need an astringent to degrease the skin, too — I like salicylic or glycolic, because they can help with the scarring that could occur, as well.”8. Go light on your makeup.Beauty products are one of the most common causes of adult acne, and unfortunately, using heavy duty makeup to hide your blemishes won’t make them physically disappear.“Use mineral makeup on your skin rather than oil-based products that can contribute to breakouts,” recommends Dr. Peredo, adding that oil-based foundation and concealer can block pores. Better yet, go totally makeup-free for a few days — it could be just the break your skin needs to clear up quick.9. Medicate if necessary.For those who suffer from cystic acne, a combination of topical products, in-office treatments (like lasers), and medication are often times the way to go. A dermatologist can work with you to find medications that will help treatment in the long-run. see: new south african songs“Nodular acne often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, and hormonal medications (oral contraceptives, spironolactone),” says Valerie Harvey, MD, a dermatologist based in Virginia. “Isotretinoin, a derivative of vitamin A, is also very effective.”10. Use light therapy to zap acne.Instead of going to your dermatologist for red and blue light therapy (which can cost upwards of $100), use an at-home device over a blemish, or over your whole face, for just two minute. The red light reduces acne inflammation, while the blue light targets acne-causing bacteria. Additionally, the light stimulates the dermal layers of the skin and produce additional collagen. In turn, acne scars fill out and the skin looks more even-toned.https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/lifestyle/secret-getting-rid-pimples-easier-015900817.html";" 28217 ";"Codedrock"

"Is There Any Solution For Blocked Tubes? - Health - Nairaland";"Russialane";"Been married for 5 years now. Before I got married, I did all fertility tests with my hubby including HSG and they all came out clean. A year after I got married and didn't conceive, my gynae asked me to repeat all my tests including HSG and they were all ok and my case was classified as unexplained infertility. Two weeks after repeating the HSG at a popular diagnostic center on Ligali Ayorinde, VI, I was rushed to the clinic due to severe stomach cramps and after series of tests, I was placed on anti biotics with no real explainations as to what could have caused the excess abdominal fluids I had in my abdomen. some months later, I was asked to do Laparoscopy and behold my tubes were blocked. After deep investigation into my case by experts it was discovered that the rusty instruments used for the last HSG caused the damage.I actually saw those instruments before the tests but the radiologist assured me its no big deal cos the instruments are sterilized. Today I'm left with blocked tubes and really don't know what to do since IVF@4 attempts too has not worked for me.I've discussed removing my tubes with both my Gynae and Hubby but non of them wants to hear of it since I'm still in my early 30s. Is there anyone with similiar problem who was able to concieve either naturally or through IVF in this forum? I'm really desperate now as my home is gradually hitting the rocks. I'v heard of fellopio and other herbal remedies used for opening the tubes, has any one used them before? Please honest advice only.";" 159053 ";"Nobody"

"When A DNA Test Says You’re A Younger Man - Health - Nairaland";"korrej";"After a bone marrow transplant, a man with leukemia found that his donor’s DNA traveled to unexpected parts of his body. A crime lab is now studying the case.Three months after his bone marrow transplant, Chris Long of Reno, Nev., learned that the DNA in his blood had changed. It had all been replaced by the DNA of his donor, a German man he had exchanged just a handful of messages with.He’d been encouraged to test his blood by a colleague at the Sheriff’s Office, where he worked. She had an inkling this might happen. It’s the goal of the procedure, after all: Weak blood is replaced by healthy blood, and with it, the DNA it contains.  But four years after his lifesaving procedure, it was not only Mr. Long’s blood that was affected. Swabs of his lips and cheeks contained his DNA — but also that of his donor. Even more surprising to Mr. Long and other colleagues at the crime lab, all of the DNA in his semen belonged to his donor. “I thought that it was pretty incredible that I can disappear and someone else can appear,” he said.Mr. Long had become a chimera, the technical term for the rare person with two sets of DNA. The word takes its name from a fire-breathing creature in Greek mythology composed of lion, goat and serpent parts. Doctors and forensic scientists have long known that certain medical procedures turn people into chimeras, but where exactly a donor’s DNA shows up — beyond blood — has rarely been studied with criminal applications in mind. Tens of thousands of people get bone marrow transplants every year, for blood cancers and other blood diseases including leukemia, lymphoma and sickle cell anemia. Though it’s unlikely that any of them would end up as the perpetrator or victim of a crime, the idea that they could intrigued Mr. Long’s colleagues at the Washoe County Sheriff’s Department, who have been using their (totally innocent) colleague in IT as a bit of a human guinea pig.Where will the DNA go?The implications of Mr. Long’s case, which was presented at an international forensic science conference in September, have now captured the interest of DNA analysts far beyond Nevada.The average doctor does not need to know where a donor’s DNA will present itself within a patient. That’s because this type of chimerism is not likely to be harmful. Nor should it change a person. “Their brain and their personality should remain the same,” said Andrew Rezvani, the medical director of the inpatient Blood & Marrow Transplant Unit at Stanford University Medical Center.He added that patients also sometimes ask him what it means for a man to have a woman’s chromosomes in their bloodstream or vice versa. “It doesn’t matter,” he said.But for a forensic scientist, it’s a different story. The assumption among criminal investigators as they gather DNA evidence from a crime scene is that each victim and each perpetrator leaves behind a single identifying code — not two, including that of a fellow who is 10 years younger and lives thousands of miles away. And so Renee Romero, who ran the crime lab at the Washoe County Sheriff’s Office, saw an opportunity when her friend and colleague told her that his doctor had found a suitable match on a donor website and he would be undergoing a bone marrow transplant.“We need to swab the heck out of you before you have this procedure to see how this DNA takes over your body,” she recalled telling him.Mr. Long agreed. He welcomed an intriguing distraction from his diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, both of which  impair the production of  healthy blood cells.";" 154 ";"korrej"

At this time I decided to speak to a mutual friend who in my opinion is closer to him and he confirmed that ""oga"" has been calling and asking for money too. I went ahead to help him as I thought whatever the case may be, he must need it and that is why he resolved to begging.Fast forward to yesterday, he reached out to me with the most disturbing messages Oga: Sir George please help me pray that the lord calls me home and grant me eternal restI was baffled by this and asked for him to clarify, and he wrote backOga:I am tired of living, life has become an illusion to me. i prefer death, I have never imagined what i am going through right, i literally leave by begging. my landlandy took me to court, because i am oweing for more that a year. the tribunal would be coming to pack my load tomorrowWe had a discussion I explained to him how taking his life is not the solution and he should exercise some patience.

"University Of Ibadan Doctors Discover Cure For AIDS - Health - Nairaland";"Allikola";"University Of Ibadan Doctors Discover Cure For AIDS, Publish In Accredited Scientific Journals-Nigerian physicians and researchers have discovered a tested cure for HIV virus, the cause of AIDS.The team of researchers who found this cure in pilot studies, Dr. Onifade Abdulfattah Adekunle, M.B.B.S., M.S., Ph.D of the Immunology unit, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Jewell AP from India, and Dr. Adedeji WA, converted several patients from an HIV positive status to a negative status in four months after first eliminating most symptoms of AIDS in the first three weeks on the remedy.The cure which is a well known and recognized herb/seed has been promised according to Muslim scripture to “hold a cure to every disease except death,” in a statement credited to Islam’s Prophet, Mohammed(s).The studies below were published in the African Journal Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the second study in the Journal of Herbal Medicine.By no coincidence, mainstream media has been silent about these ground-breaking results since it was discovered.The CureNatural Society reports:Nigella Sativa, also known as “black seed,” is experiencing a boom in popularity as the number of scientific studies affirming its long-supposed benefits are coming to light. Now, a remarkable case study stands to add “HIV treatment” to its list of potential benefits.MUSLIM HADITHAbu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that the Prophet sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam ( may Allah exalt his mention ) said:  “Use this Black Seed regularly, because it is a cure for every disease, except death.” [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]First StudyThe study, published in the African Journal of Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine, tells the story of an HIV patient who went into complete remission after black seed treatment.As published in the first study, the patient was treated with Nigella sativa for a period of six months, after which there was no detectable HIV virus or antibodies against HIV in his bloodstream. Further, the HIV stayed gone.The study abstract explains that the patient, who saw an herbalist, was suffering with symptoms common in HIV, including chronic fever, weight loss, lesions, and diarrhea. But the black seed treatment had impressive and near-immediate results.“The patient was commenced on Nigella sativa concoction 10 mls twice daily for 6 months.. He was contacted daily to monitor side-effects and drug efficacy. Fever, diarrhoea and multiple pruritic lesions disappeared on 5th, 7th and 20th day respectively on Nigella sativa therapy. “On the 187th day, HIV tests came back negative. Further, 24 months after the therapy was stopped, the tests remained negative for HIV and HIV antibodies, researchers, Onifade AA1, Jewell AP, and Adedeji WA published.Abstract contd. Examination revealed moderate weight loss, and the laboratory tests of ELISA (Genscreen) and western blot (new blot 1 & 2) confirmed sero-positivity to HIV infection with pre-treatment viral (HIV-RNA) load and CD4 count of 27,000 copies/ml and CD4 count of 250 cells/ mm(3) respectively. The patient was commenced on Nigella sativa concoction 10 mls twice daily for 6 months.. He was contacted daily to monitor side-effects and drug efficacy. Fever, diarrhoea and multiple pruritic lesions disappeared on 5th, 7th and 20th day respectively on Nigella sativa therapy. The CD4 count decreased to 160 cells/ mm3 despite significant reduction in viral load (≤1000 copies/ml) on 30th day on N. sativa. Repeated EIA and Western blot tests on 187th day on Nigella sativa therapy was sero-negative. The post therapy CD4 count was 650 cells/ mm(3) with undetectable viral (HIV-RNA) load.Generally, HIV is treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). This conventional therapy is controversial because the side-effects are often far worse than the viral symptoms to begin with. There are indications that the treatment, and not the HIV virus at all, can be blamed for many HIV-credited fatalities.“This case report reflects the fact that there are possible therapeutic agents in Nigella sativa that may effectively control HIV infection,” concluded the study authors, adding HIV treatment to the long list of potential black seed benefits.As we reported a few months ago on the benefits of black seed (Part I and Part II), the seed has been used for centuries as a healing remedy. A few of the known benefits include treatment of:•Various type of cancer•Epilepsy•Type 2 diabetes•MRSA•Brain damage from lead•Asthma•Radiation damage•High blood pressureNigella sativa can be found online and in health stores under the names black seed and occasionally black cumin. However, because “black cumin” is a common name applied to a completely different seed, make sure the product is labeled as Nigella sativa.Second studyAs can be seen in the abstract below, in the second study, six patients were converted to a sero-negative status four months post therapy on a special preparation of black seed with honey called α-Zam.Effectiveness of a herbal remedy in six HIV patients in NigeriaAbstractThe failure of conventional medicine to cure the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection compels many people living with the virus to seek alternative therapy. This pilot study determined the effectiveness (clinical and laboratory responses) of α-Zam (defined by the herbal therapist as Nigella sativa and honey), which is used by patients seeking herbal remedies for HIV infection in Nigeria. Six patients taking this herbal concoction as an alternative therapy for HIV infection were recruited into the study and monitored for 4 months. All six patients were infected by HIV, as confirmed by Western blot analysis in the nearest teaching hospital, i.e. LAUTECH teaching hospital or Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, before commencing preliminary clinical and laboratory examinations using World Health Organization (WHO) and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. The patients were contacted daily and visited regularly after commencement of herbal medications to assess the efficacy (disappearance of presenting signs and symptoms associated with HIV infection), side-effects, drug toxicity, and compliance. The symptoms and signs associated with HIV infection disappeared within 20 days of commencement of herbal therapy with significant difference (p < 0.05) before treatment and at periodic intervals on α-Zam therapy. Body weight increased from an average of 53 ± 2 kg to 63 ± 2 kg, viral load (HIV-RNA) decreased from 42,300 ± 1500 copies/ml to an undetectable level (≤50 copies/ml), and CD4+ count increased from an average of 227 ± 9 to 680 ± 12 mm3/μL at 4 months post-therapy. This study concluded that the herbal remedy (α-Zam) is effective in the treatment of HIV infection based on a significant improvement in both the clinical features and laboratory results of HIV infection. However, a longer follow-up is suggested to ensure that the observed improvement is sustained. In addition, a large population study is needed to confirm our observation in this cohort of people.Several other HIV patients in various countries including the United States have described the same results with the use of Black seed.

"Northern States Top List Of Women Not Using Contraceptives, Report Shows - Health - Nairaland";"Stat101";"Nigeria has the largest population in Africa, and it is growing at approximately 3.2% each year as reported by Voice of Africa. In April this year, the U.S. Census Bureau says that at that rate, there will be an estimated 402 million people in Nigeria by 2050. The ever increasing population in Nigeria will eventually become a curse if not well managed.The importance and the role of family planning in addressing this danger of overpopulation in Nigeria should and must be looked into. Family planning is a key factor in achieving Sustainable Development Goal, and getting it right can help Nigeria in meeting related targets such as education, particularly for women and girls.Yobe, Sokoto and Katsina states top the list of women (15-49 year) not using contraception with 98.1%, 97.7% and 96.6% respectively.

"Top 10 Cancer-fighting Foods - Health - Nairaland";"Hopepeters";"1. Garlic:Garlic is one of the most powerful anti-cancer fighting foods, it has immune-enhancing alliums compounds that appear to increase the activity of immune cells that fight cancer and indirectly help break down cancer-causing substances. These substances also help block carcinogens from entering cells and slow tumor development, Study shows that people who consume raw or cooked garlic regularly face about half the risk of stomach cancer and colorectal cancer.2. Mushrooms:Mushrooms are one of the most powerful functional foods for preventing and treating cancer. Shiitake mushrooms are believed to be effective in fighting the development and progression of cancer by boosting the body’s immune system, besides shiitake other varieties of mushrooms that boost anti-cancer benefits include; Maitake, Reishi and phellinus Linteus. These mushrooms contain polysaccharides, especially Lentinan, powerful compounds that help in building immunity; they are a source of beta-glucan. They also have a protein called lectin which attacks cancerous cells and prevents them from spreading. They also contain Thioprolin, these mushrooms can stimulate the production of interferon in the body. 3. Broccoli:Broccoli contains a chemical component called infole-3-carbinol that can fight breast cancer by converting a cancer-promoting estrogen into a more protective variety, it also has the phytochemical sulforaphane that is believed to aid in preventing some type of cancer like colon and rectal cancer. 4. Grapes:Grapes are rich in polyphenolic phytochemical compound resveratrol which inhibits the enzymes that can stimulate cancer-cell growth and suppress the immune response. They also contain ellagic acid a compound that blocks enzymes that are necessary for cancer cells; this appears to help slow the growth of tumors. 5. Green Tea:Green tea contains certain antioxidants known as polyphenols which appear to prevent cancer cells from dividing. Reports have it that these polyphenols that are abundant in green tea may protect against various types of cancer. Dry green tea leaves which are about 40% polyphenols by weight may also reduce the risk of cancer of the stomach, lung, colon, rectum, liver, and pancreas.Continue Reading Here: https://www.topups.icu/2019/12/top-10-cancer-fighting-foods.html#more";" 76 ";"Hopepeters"
"Safety Of Nigerian Herbal Remedies - Nomacin Plus In Perspective - Health - Nairaland";"sphinx54";"Herbal remedies are now widely accepted in Nigeria for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections and some are also used as aphrodisiacs. Unfortunately,  most consumers often fail to carry out research to determine the effects of the constituents of some of these preparations. This post is attributed to the dilemma my close friend is currently facing. He bought a certain herbal preparation known as NOMACIN PLUS which is believed to be an STD killer. Hoping to permanently rid his system of an unknown STD, he religiously took the drug as directed by the agent  for close to a week. He however met me and complained of symptoms such as dizziness, difficulty urinating, back pain, headaches and the likes. Based on the information my friend gave, I quickly googled the constituents of NOMACIN PLUS which are ALSTONIA BOONEI (60%), COLOCYNTHIS CITRULUS(30%) and XYLOPIA AETHIOPICA, with a view to finding out if they are safe for use. Note that the weight of these constituents (in grams) were not even indicated on the pack or leaflet. As expected, ALSTONIA BOONEI is believed to produce side effects such as stuffy nose, irritability, allergic reactions, eye problems, kidney problems, depression, and psychotic reactions. Large doses can cause heart problems and death. COLOCYNTHIS CITRULUS is reported by webMD to be unsafe and the website added that the constituent was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991. WebMD further highlighted the following; ""Taking even small amounts of colocynth can cause severe irritation of the stomach and intestine lining, bloody diarrhea, kidney damage, bloody urine, and inability to urinate. Other side effects include convulsions, paralysis, and death. There have been reports of death following ingestion of less than 2 grams of the powder. In clinical trials, mild diarrhea has been reported with as little as 300 mg of colocynth powder."" Similar undesirable side effects were outlined for XYLOPIA AETHIOPICA. My issue is why NAFDAC would endorse such a drug for consumption by Nigerians. At least the amount in grams of the composition of the drugs should have been given to know of it falls within safe levels. You guys won't believe the amount of negative findings by researchers in respect of these so called natural chemicals. More worrisome is that the leaflets inserted in the pack arries no information about side effects of the drug. Could it be that the marketers or producers deliberately want to harm innocent Nigerians. My answer is in the affirmative because the website written on the pack (www.greatherbal.org) is non existent, which is awfully appalling. For your awareness, the NAFDAC Reg Number pasted on the drug is A7-1261L. Our alternative medicine producers/manufacturers should please thread with caution to avoid killing patients oh! Let's shine our eyes please, dont just consume anything without knowing what that thing actually is. It could save lives. Pictures attached for your viewing pleasure.

"Stop Being 2 Minutes Noodles In Bed. Indomie Takes More Than 2 Minutes now - Health - Nairaland";"yemmsykayanmata";"With Kayanmata and Kayanmaza herbal medicines..........I receive messages from men, young and old, troubled by this issue of premature ejaculation all seeking solutions to help put an end to it, sometimes I receive messages from wives who have been left unsatisfied and frustrated by their husband’s ” one or two minute” match in the bedroom ,so I have decided to explore this topic, the causes, temporary and permanent solutions.so let’s start What causes premature ejaculation? Many men suffering from the condition would like to know why they don’t “last” long enough for them (or their partner) to really enjoy sex.Premature ejaculation happens shortly before or after penetration, although there is no precise “time limit” that defines it. Depending on different places and cultures it mostly means lasting less than two minutes. In order to deal with the problem, it’s crucial to understand the causes of premature ejaculation. These causes can include excessive excitement, fear of performance problems and other forms of anxiety. It can also include physical causes such as acute hypersensitivity of the nervous system. What Causes Premature Ejaculation?Although there is no universal definition, ejaculation is usually considered to be premature if it occurs within 2 minutes of intercourse or if the man cannot control the ejaculation.Premature ejaculation may be caused by stress, performance-related anxiety and other relationship issues. It can also be caused by hypersensitivity of the skin of the penis (in which case, numbing creams can help). Who is affected by premature ejaculation?Although the condition is more common in men under 35, it generally tends to occur in men who are dealing with a new situation, such as a new relationship, a new experience or a stressful situation in the relationship (e.g. tensions or conflicts). A condition in need of further researchUnfortunately, the causes of premature ejaculation are not fully understood. This is partly due to lack of research/data on the condition, but also because of the underlying psychological factors which make it hard to identify a clear cause.It is difficult to determine what causes premature ejaculation, whether it is caused by psychological factors, hypersensitive nerves in the penis or a combination of both.In general, it seems that a combination of different techniques and treatments works best for men suffering from premature ejaculation (PE) But with Kayanmata and Kayanmaza herbal medicine you can get things right temporarily and permanently..First;-- KayanMata:KayanMata is originated from the Northern tribes of Nigeria.

The last part was okay, I guess cos am a fitness trainer and fashion model so I have to look my very stunning best. I did my research and also, from personal experience, I came to realize that certain foods i and all other ulcer patients consume are deadly to the stomach. So here they are :1. Beans. This is the worst food an ulcer patient can eat because of its abundance of acids. 2. Garri. 3. Garden egg. 4. Pepper soup. 5. Spicy curries and soups. 6. Soft drinks and any other carbonated drinks 7. Alcohol 8. Cigarettes 9. Fried foods 10. Grapes11. Sugar12. Salt13. Very hot foods. Steer clear of the aforementioned foods and by the grace of God the pylori will be eradicated.";" 43582 ";"KingsleyAni1993"

"World Hepatitis Day: Are Hepatitis B And C Curable? An Overview- Dr Seyitan - Health - Nairaland";"udomoh";"Are Hepatitis B and C curable?Hepatitis is simply put, inflammation of the liver, that is, the body’s response to an insult to the liver. Several agents can “insult” the liver, from toxins to chemicals (alcohol) to infectious agents like viruses and parasites.However, the focus of this article is on hepatitis caused by viruses. Of the various hepatotripic (liver-loving) viruses, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus stand out, because of the ability of these viruses to persist in the liver for long periods of time, causing long term damage and deterioration to the liver over many years. This often leads to liver failure or liver cancer (hepatocelluar carcinoma).These viruses are transmitted via blood (sharing or sharps, accidental needle stick injuries, transfusion of unscreened blood etc.) and body fluids like vaginal secretions and semen.Infected persons can present acutely with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, body aches, low-grade fever before developing yellowish discoloration of their sclerae (white part of the eyes), skin and mucous membranes. In the late stages, patients could develop signs of chronic liver disease such as abdominal swelling with fluid (ascites), swelling of the feet (pedal edema), muscle wasting, redness of the palms (palmar erythema), enlargement of the liver and spleen etc.It could also be asymptomatic, leaving the sufferer unaware of the infection, often for many years before they are discovered incidentally by screening.Any individual experiencing any of these symptoms, or who is at risk of exposure to these viruses can walk into a health centre and have some screening tests done i.e. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg), Hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) and other ancillary tests like the liver function test and abdominal ultrasound (more useful for those with the infection).Anyone with a positive HBSAg test would be required to do a full Hepatitis B panel (Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B e antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody IgM and IgG, Hepatitis B e antibody, Hepatitis B Virus DNA), which would determine the phase of infection and guide treatment.On the other hand, those who test positive to Hepatitis C would proceed to quantify the virus by doing a viral load which would also guide treatment.Most interestingly, the treatment of these viral hepatitides (plural for hepatitis) are experiencing major breakthroughs, with new drugs being discovered and cures being achieved. Hepatitis B remains yet uncurable, but all hope is not lost.New antiviral agents are being discovered and current ones are able to suppress viral load to the barest minimum… enough to prevent progression of the disease to end stage/ end game.It however gives me great pleasure to write that Hepatitis C CAN and has been CURED in many individuals. Initially, for many decades only medications like ribavirin and interferon were available, with disappointing cure rates and side effects that made “the cure of the disease more grievous than the endurance of the same.”The newer drugs and drug combinations are however doing the trick more conveniently (oral administration), cheaper (than prolonged suffering and death), with much less side effects and for only about 8-12 weeks.These wonder combos include Ledispasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni), Elbasvir/grazoprevir (Zepatier), Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Dasabuvir (Viekira Pak), Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/Ritonavir (Technivie) and Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa). Combination therapy is much more efficacious than monotherapy.Like the adage goes, prevention is indeed better than cure and this holds true for hepatitis B and C virus infection.Hepatitis B vaccine should be given to new borns and immunoglobulins added for babies born to infected mothers. Hepatitis B vaccine for adults are also available, some of which last for life.Other preventive strategies generally involve having respect for our bodies and treating our livers nicely, by avoiding alcohol (especially the excess of it), self medication, sharing of sharps (like razors, nail cutters, hair clippers, ear rings etc), adequate protection during sexual intercourse (especially for an unmarried couple where their statuses are not known), and avoiding illicit (intravenous) drug use.Also, blood for transfusion should be well screened and health workers should be extra careful to avoid unprecedented needle stick injuries and avoid unnecessary contact with blood and body fluids of patients.On a final note, when has routine health checks ever harmed anybody? Do well to get yourself screened. Better safe than sorry.https://nimedhealth.com.ng/2019/05/13/are-hepatitis-b-and-c-curable-an-overview/?amp";" 17652 ";"udomoh"

"Lets Talk About CBD Oil (CBD Awareness Program) - Health - Nairaland";"Agroprenuer";"Cannabidiol is a popular natural remedy used for many common ailments.Better known as CBD, it is one of over 100 chemical compounds known as cannabinoids found in the cannabis or marijuana plant, Cannabis sativa. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting “high” that’s often associated with marijuana. However, unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive. This quality makes CBD an appealing option for those who are looking for relief from pain and other symptoms without the mind-altering effects of marijuana or certain pharmaceutical drugs.CBD oil is made by extracting CBD from the cannabis plant, then diluting it with a carrier oil like coconut or hemp seed oil.It’s gaining momentum in the health and wellness world, with some scientific studies confirming it may ease symptoms of ailments like chronic pain and anxiety.";" 66 ";"Agroprenuer"

"Switching Over To Natural Products (The Babies Corner) - Health - Nairaland";"SimpleLuxuries";"Dear Mummies & Daddies,We are advocates for natural baby skincare products. We noticed the average baby soap contains at least 23 chemicals most of which are petroleum derivatives designed to increase lathering effect. Some of these ingredients like Sodium Laureth Sulphate (SLS), Parabens and even fragrances have been found to cause harmful effects in the long run like allergies and respiratory problems.Our products are handmade and based mainly on natural oils and plant butters. This is because we realise they can cleanse the skin without stripping it of its natural oils. The Moisturising baby soap is made mainly from Shea butter and Neem oil. This is because the oils are rich in fatty acids like Oleic, Linoleic and Palmitic acids which are required for healthy, supple skin. A baby's skin is much thinner than ours because it is at its developmental stage. It requires nourishment as well as protection from toxins and infections. Shea butter Neem oil (when in unrefined form) have a lot of antifungal and antibacterial properties. Together they stave off eczema, lice, scabies and ringworm.To get more info, please check out our IG and Facebook pages @Pureloveng Please send us a PM to order or if you are interested in being a reseller.Happy Sunday!";" 45 ";"SimpleLuxuries"

This virus affects the external Instruments, anal region, mucosal surfaces, and skin in other parts of the body.Herpes is a long term condition. However, many people never have symptoms even though they are carrying the virus. Symptoms include blisters, ulcers, pain when urinating, cold sores, and vaginal discharge, Pimple like breakouts on parts of the body which contain watery substances when scratched. Although there is no known conventional medical cure for herpes, I am glad to announce that here I have the cure. When I say cure, I mean total cure for it.Several cases have been brought to me and we have recorded a 100% cure rate. Treatment is gradual and given orally as well as applied topically as herbal remedies and herbal topical cream.There are no side effects as the treatment is very well tolerated.Recently our latest case is that of a 3 year old boy who was born infected with herpes. His mother was infected and passed the infection to him during childbirth. His symptoms begam manifesting from when he was 2months old and he has been taken to various hospitals and received all manner of treatment but all to no avail.He was brought to my notice almost 3 weeks ago and I assessed his condition and it was indeed a very bad infection for him. His entire back, right and left sides of his body, buttocks and thighs were covered in water filled rashes which were rather large, he had very little appetite for food, could not be exposed to sunlight due to pain, was difficult to bath due to pain, and had a fever.Treatment for him commenced almost immediately as the herbs for his treatment were always prepared fresh at the scene of treatment for potency preservation.His treatment has been ongoing for 2 weeks now and attached are his pictures from 2 days ago and from today.";" 7508 ";"Adalassy"

"Benefits Of Wearing A Bra To Bed - Health - Nairaland";"megajay1";"One of the more common questions that women ask about sleeping is if it is a good idea to sleep in a bra at night or not. When you really stop to examine some of the facts about sleeping in a bra, you will find that there are advantages as well as some possible disadvantages in doing so. In this article, we are going to cover both but we're going to try to focus on the positive aspects of sleeping in a bra, as it may be something that you choose to do. The first thing that I would like to say is that there are some myths about wearing a bra at night which need to be dispelled immediately. One of the more common of those myths is that wearing a bra while you are sleeping can lead to an increased risk for breast cancer.This is absolutely not true. There are no studies or evidence to support that statement and women have been sleeping in their bras for many years without ever developing any problems with breast cancer. There are so many other contributing factors to breast cancer that need to be avoided but wearing a bra at night is not one of them. That is why I would suggest, if you enjoy wearing a bra at night and find it to be comfortable, go right ahead and do so. There are specific benefits to wearing a bra while you are sleeping that should also be considered. If you are large breasted, wearing a bra while you sleep will help you to avoid any premature sagging of the breasts. It is also beneficial for women who have recently undergone breast surgery. It will help to support the breasts and to keep them from getting sore due to the surgery that was recently done. If you are going to wear a bra at night, it is important for you to choose one that is comfortable. If you tend to wear an underwEAR bra during the day, it is best if you choose a bra that does not have that underwire for sleeping at night. Although you may find it to be perfectly fine in doing so, some women have a problem with a bra digging into them and creating discomfort while they sleep. It may not wake them enough to bring them entirely conscious but it may disrupt their sleep enough that they are tired the next day. Finally, choose a bra that is not too tight, and you may actually want to choose one that is slightly loose for sleeping. The lymph fluid drains in the breasts during the night and if you wear a bra that is too tight, it is going to disrupt this process. They can also make you uncomfortable, which is certainly something that you would want to avoid while you were sleeping. So the bottom line is, if you enjoy wearing a bra at night and it makes you feel comfortable, go right ahead and do so.

"5 Early Symptoms Of Cancer In Men!! All Men Should Know - Health - Nairaland";"HealthSmart";"Knowing early symptoms of cancer can help you seek treatment sooner to better your chances of remission. This article is really important so read carefully to the end.￼Male hands holding prostate cancer awareness ribbon with mustache - stock photoHere are5 early symptoms of cancer in men:1.Blood in your pee or stoolOne of the best ways to fight the disease is to catch it in the early stages when it’s more treatable. The problem is that the warning signs for many kinds of cancer can seem pretty mild.Blood in your pee or stoolIt is very important to visit the doctor when you notice blood in your pee or stool because it could be first signs of cancer of the bladder, kidneys, or colon. Although you're more likely to have a problem that's not cancer, like hemorrhoids or a urinary infection, it's important to treat it at the early stages.2.Urinary changesUrinary changes may develop as you age but certain symptoms may indicate prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is most common in men ages 60 and older.Common urinary symptoms include:Urinary leaksIncontinenceAn inability to urinate despite urges to goDelayed urinationStraining during urination3.Persistent back painBack pain may be a symptom of cancer. Symptoms of cancer may not show until it has spread to other parts of your body, such as the bones of your spine. For example, prostate cancer is especially prone to spread to the bones and may cause these symptoms within your hip bones and lower back.Unlike occasional muscle pain, cancer of the bone causes tenderness and discomfort in your bones.4.Unusual coughingA persistent cough is an early sign of lung cancer. If you don’t have any other related symptoms, such as a stuffy nose or fever, the cough probably isn’t due to a virus or infection.Coughing accompanied with bloody mucus is also associated with lung cancer in men.5.Changes in your testicles""If you notice a lump, heaviness, or any other change in your testicle, never delay having it looked at,"" says Herbert Lepor, MD, urology chairman at New York University Langone Medical Center.""Unlike prostate cancer, which grows slowly, testicular cancer can take off overnight."" Your doctor will look for any problems with a physical exam, blood tests, and an ultrasound of your scrotum.Source: https://thesmartcitizens.com/2019/12/08/5-early-symptoms-of-cancer-in-men-all-men-should-know/";" 192 ";"HealthSmart"

"Ladies, Swallow Your Man’s Sperm Without Regret: 5 Health Benefits Of Semen - Health - Nairaland";"RenewHealth";"To swallow sperm during sex is what some women really do not understand. For such women, semen is strictly a “baby making substance”. Well, it’s a lot more than that! Scientific research and tests over the years have opened our eyes to the many health and nutritional benefits semen offer to women when they swallow some. In this article, I will be discussing 5 health & nutritional benefits of men’s semen to women.It has been discovered that exposure to semen is very beneficial to women’s health. All thanks to the mood-altering chemicals this body fluid possesses.Before we proceed, let us have a better understanding of what semen is.Semen is a creamy substance, yellowish or greyish in color and it is made up of spermatozoa and seminal plasma fluid.The spermatozoa makes up about 5% of the semen. They look like tadpoles and they are the reproductive cells that are made up of the genetic information used to create a human offspring.The seminal plasma fluid, which is mainly 80% water makes up the rest of the semen. It’s job is to carry the spermatozoa to its destination.To Swallow Sperm: Is It Safe For A Woman To Ingest A Man’s Semen?The answer here is yes. This is because the elements that make up the semen are safe.Semen digests just the same way the human body digests regular food. However, in very rare cases, some people might find that they are allergic to semen when ingested. This condition is called Human Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity (HSP)Keep in mind that you have to be careful when swallowing semen since it may have viruses. These viruses can easily be transmitted if ingested.MouthAction may lead to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Hepatitis B and C, as well as herpes. So it’s important to know the health status of your partner before you swallow his sperm, just to be safe.What Are The Vitamins Found In Semen?The spermatozoa found in semen, along with the fluids come with a whole bunch of healthy vitamins that are awesome. Ladies, your man’s semen contain the following –Sugar (fructose & glucose)SodiumCitrateZincChlorideCalciumLactic acidMagnesiumPotassiumUreaThe nutrients that come with semen are laced with calories. A single teaspoon of semen (which is the average volume a man releases per ejaculation) measures up to about 7 calories.As for the taste of semen, well it’s hard to put a finger on that, since it can vary from individual to individual. Some women have said they find the taste salty and bitter, while others have said it’s a bit sugary.Some researchers are of the opinion that a man’s diet can influence the taste of his semen, but there isn’t any concrete evidence to support that claim. At least not yet.There are a good number of foods that can even out the taste of semen and make it a lot more palatable. These include –CeleryParsleyWheatgrassCinnamonNutmegPineapplePapayaOrangesConcerning the taste of semen, well that also varies from person to person, and this could be dependent on factors like the man’s diet, hygiene and health.The most commonly relatable smell of semen is that of bleach. This is because of its composition, which provides the required pH level where the spermatozoa can survive.Semen in most cases is neutral or alkaline, around 7.26 – 8.40 on the pH scale. This ranges from 0 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline)If the smell of semen is musky, then it could be due to external factors.Your man’s diet can directly affect the smell of his semen. Just as the asparagus affects the smell of urine.So ladies, now that you have a better understanding of what semen is and what it’s made of, let’s proceed to discuss the top 5 health & nutritional benefits of men’s semen to women.Health Benefits of Men’s Semen1. Semen Elevates A Woman’s MoodAccording to a study which analyzed the effects of semen’s “mood altering chemicals”, MouthAction makes women feel happier.Scientists at the University Of New York conducted a study which compared the sex lives of 239 females to their mental health. It was discovered that seminal fluid contained chemicals that elevates a woman’s mood. Strange but true.Survey results showed that women who were directly exposed to the semen showed significantly better mood behavior and lower symptoms of depression.Being in a good mood will help you be more positive and productive, it will also reduce stress levels caused by worry.Give it a try next time you and your man have MouthAction, and you’d be “happy” you did!2. Semen Helps Women Fight InsomniaUsually, after a good round of sex, it is very common for both man and woman to fall asleep. You may think it’s all the “hard work” that put you to sleep, but it’s not.Studies have shown that whether you swallow sperm or it enters your blood stream through your vagina, it will help you fall asleep fast, thanks to the chemical melatonin which is found in semen.This component of a man’s semen is a form of relaxant that helps women be at ease and fall asleep.So, if you’re a lady who keeps struggling with sleep, then I suggest you swallow your man’s semen (as long as he is virus free). Thank me later!3. It Adds Extra Nutrients To Your MealsAccording to the research of Paul Fotie Photenhauer, semen adds a world of nutrients to your meals.As I mentioned earlier, semen is rich in minerals and vitamins, and it has been proven that it adds some “extra value” to your meals. Besides the extra nutrients, semen has a great texture so it blends well with food.Next time you want to make dinner, consider adding some semen to it. It goes very well!4. Semen Is An Anti-depressantThe chemical components of semen helps fight depression. This may seem strange (or new) to you but it’s true!Scientific studies have proven that women who swallow their man’s sperm have lower chances of being depressed. This is not to say that semen is the sole answer to depression, it is just a statement of fact that it’s components have anti-depressant qualities.The nerve growth factor found in semen is a vital hormone that’s missing in the brains of those who have been diagnosed with major depressive disorders. This naturally means that increasing nerve growth factor would make women happier.To add to that, nerve growth factor has anti-inflamatory and anti-oxidant properties.Some of the anti-depressant components of semen include –EndorphinsEstroneProlactinOxytocinThyrotropin releasing hormoneSerotonin5. Stronger And Healthier HairThey say a woman’s hair is her “crown”, well I’m sure you’d like to have your crown strong, shiny and looking great all the time. Believe it or not, men’s semen will do this for your hair.You must have heard of “Keratin Treatment”, where you pay a decent sum of money to put protein in your hair for the benefit of making it stronger. Apparently semen has over 200 different types of protein, these proteins can give your hair the glow and strength you desire.Semen also has a component called spermadine which can be used on human scalps. Spermadine promotes shaft elongation as well as consistent hair growth.Some women tend to intentionally keep semen out of their hair during MouthAction, mainly because of its stickiness, well think again!I recommend semen as a natural hair treatment, consider this the next time you want to have a make-over.Before I leave, I’d like to remind you to consider a few important things first.You may be allergic to semen – As I mentioned earlier in this article, some people (even though very rare) are allergic to semen. Remember when I mentioned Human Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity? That’s the name given to semen allergy. This allergy could lead to itching, hives, chest tightness and difficulty in breathing. Be sure you are not allergic to semen before you swallow!It doesn’t come in huge quantities – A full ejaculation is equivalent to about a teaspoon so you would need a good amount of ejaculation to experience some of the benefits listed above. These results would start to manifest over time the more you swallowMake sure the semen is STD free – This is the most important thing to remember before you ingest your man’s semen. Be absolutely sure that your partner is STD free before you proceed to swallow or ingest his semen. Feel free to go with him to the clinic and do some tests, you’d be more confident this wayConclusionGreat, so those are the top 5 health and nutritional benefits of semen. Consider these the next time you have MouthAction with your man.This may seem all new to you but it is fact, your man’s semen does have some great nutrients packed up inside which can be beneficial to you.How much do you enjoy it and what's your take on it?MUST READ>> Men, swallow your lady’s ejaculate without regret: 5 Nutritional and health benefits of women’s ejaculatehttps://renewhealth.life/health-benefits-of-womens-semen-ejaculate/ https://renewhealth.life/swallow-sperm-health-benefits/";" 233 ";"RenewHealth"

"Are You Looking For A Lasting Solution For Typhoid - Health - Nairaland";"Healthyway15";"Typhoid is caused by bacteria Salmonella typhi. It is a serious health condition especially in the developing world. Typhoid risk is higher in populations that lack access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Causes of Typhoid Fever Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or through close contact with someone who's infected. Most people feel better within a few days of starting antibiotic treatment, although a small number of them may die of complications. Early symptoms of Typhoid Fever Symptoms are likely to develop gradually, often appearing 1-3weeks after exposure to the disease. They include : headache, sweating, abdominal pain, weakness and tiredness, loss of appetite and weight loss, diarrhoea/constipation, extremely swollen abdomenLater symptoms You may become delirious, lie motionless and exhausted with your eyes half-closed. Life-threatening complications often develop at this time. The most serious complications of typhoid are intestinal bleeding or holes(perforations).Treatment of Typhoid Fever The most commonly used antibiotic is ciprofloxacin. Taking antibiotics to treat typhoid only work if typhoid is caught early. If not, typhoid can be fatal. There is currently concern about the growing resistance of antibiotics to S. typhi.

If the bacteria gain access to the body either through a wound on the skin or via the respiratory tract, they can cause serious infections.While anyone can get a staph infection, some conditions put people at higher risk including : newborns, skin injuries, diabetes, breastfeeding women, lung disease etc.Symptoms of Staph infectionsPus-filled abscesses (also called boils), pain, swelling and redness in the area of the infection is common. If the staph infection is in the blood (Sepsis), symptoms can include fever, cold and low blood pressure.Types of Diseases caused by Staph Infection include : Impetigo (superficial skin infection), cellulitis (an infection of the skin layers), staph bacteria in the lungs can cause pneumonia. If staph infection gets into the bloodstream, it can spread to other organs and cause severe and life-threatening infections (Sepsis). Sepsis can lead to shock or multi-organ failure, which can rapidly lead to death.Staph Infection and Male InfertilityUrinogenital tract infections in males are one of the leading factors in infertility in males.

"5 Tips On How To Live A Good Life - Health - Nairaland";"mrkunlex";"Living the good life means different things to differentpeople. There is, however, a slightly ambiguous,mutual understanding.It deals with the simple pleasures that make youhappy, the compassionate deeds you perform, thepersonal goals you strive to achieve, the relationshipsyou nurture and the legacy you leave behind. Sincerepersonal fulfillment is generally the collective endresult. The good life is also about appreciating all yourtime, not just your leisure time. Far too many peopleget caught up in the mad rush of a corporate lifestyleand grow completely numb to the little momentsshared with loved ones, the simple building blocks oftime that make life magical. Time, after all, is thesingle greatest element of life.5 Tips On How To Live A Good Life1. IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT YOUYou were lied to, when you were told that if youworked enough hours, got enough stuff, and followedenough rules, that you’d be okay.That you’d be happy. But now, hopefully, you knowthe truth: We only find fulfillment when we let go ofcomfort, when we risk losing everything. That’s whata really good story, and incidentally what a reallygood life, is all about.2. Passion Is Not OptionalIt’s not enough to simply commit to a task and do itreally well for the rest of your life. You were put onthis earth to do something, something specific.Until you do, you will be anxious and on-edge.Passion is what we need to have a fulfilled, wholelife. Of course, passion alone won’t necessarily getyou everything you want, but without it, you will diea slow, bitter death.3. Just because it’s hard doesn’t mean you shouldn’tdo itAnything worth doing shouldn’t be easy. It willrequire courage and strength from you, otherwise, it’sprobably not worth doing at all. Nobody goes to thegym to feel good, and have fun. They go there tosweat and scream and stretch themselves. And theyleave better versions of the people that entered anhour before. If you’re going to grow, life will at timesbe hard. Get used to it.4. EMBRACE FEAR AS A PART OF LIFEWhy do we all get fearful. We shouldn’t fear fear. Weshould embrace fear as a part of life. Fear is theflinch, telling us that we could die.It reminds us of what’s dangerous and why we’reprone to avoid pain. Fear is good. It keeps us alive,but it also keeps us compliant if we’re not careful. Myrule of thumb is this, if I don’t feel afraid of doingsomething, then I’m probably playing it too safe, andi’m not getting into risks which is not a goodperception of life .5. VALUES ARE BETTER THAN GOALSIf you don’t know where you stand at work, friendsand family when an opportunity to succeed atsomething comes along, you’ll screw it up.The best way to get your life in order. Screw thegoals and skip the plans. Jump straight to values,your non-negotiable for how you do business, treatyour loved ones, and do life. Everything else fallsunder this. Sure, plans are good and goals are fine.But even Hitler had goals. The Nazis had a very well-designed plan. That’s not enough to live a good life.You have to have values, good ones, in order for yourlife to make a positive dent in this universe.This tips should help you discover the real you andthe strength to carry on in this crazy and stressfulworld we live in, look at the world from anotherperspective and thing should turn out just fine foryou. Don’t give up on yourself just yet.Read More Here";" 80 ";"mrkunlex"

"Top 10 Cancer Causing Foods You Should Avoid To Prevent Cancer - Health - Nairaland";"Hopepeters";"1. Pickled And Smoked FoodsPickled and smoked foods are delicious but at this same time are very harmful to the body, in fact, smoked meats that pick up tar from the smoking process cause extreme harm to your body, plus most pickled foods contain nitrates that turn in N-nitroso which increases your risk of cancer. Moreover, they contain preservatives to prolong shelf life which can accumulate in your body over time. This can cause damage at the cellular level and lead to cancer and other diseases. Smoked foods are high in fat and when cooked at high temperatures the nitrates are converted to nitrites, which is even more harmful to the body. Try to avoid pickled and smoked foods as much as possible.2. Processed Or Red MeatProcessed meats such as ham, sausage and bacon have chemicals and preservatives like sodium nitrates which make them bad for your health. In addition, processed meat contains excessive salt, which is also not good for your health. In a 2008 study published in the Nutrition and Cancer journal, researchers found that processed meat intake might be involved in the aetiology of colorectal cancer. More shocking statistics shared by the organic consumer’s association revel hot dogs commonly contain sodium nitrite, a cancer-causing ingredient the USDA has been trying to ban since the 1970s. Leukaemia risk soared a staggering 700% with hot dog consumption. Look for eats free of nitrites to help reduce your risk with these cancer-causing foods. Along with processed meat, you must avoid excessive intake of red meat that can lead to a higher risk of colon and prostate cancer.3. Refined White Flour Refined White Flour Contains excess carbohydrates that are not good for your health and even increase the risk of cancer. During the milling process, white flour is bleached with chlorine gas which is highly toxic for the body; studies have shown that excess carbohydrate intake increases the risk of breast cancer among women. In addition, white flour has a high-glycemic the rate that rapidly raises blood sugar levels. A spike in blood sugar promotes cancer cell growth and spreading. Instead of using refined white flour, try some healthier option like whole-wheat, almond, quinoa or arly flour. You can use these flours for baking or making bread.4. Refined And Artificial Sugars Refined sugar artificial sweeteners and fructose-sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup are not good for your health. These products tend to rapidly spike insulin levels and feed the growth of cancer cells. According to a 2006 study published in the American society for clinical nutrition journal, high intake of sugar and sugar-sweetened foods increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. Instead of using refined sugar or artificial sweeteners, you can try alternatives like honey, jaggery, blackstrap molasses, maple syrup to sweeten any dish.5. Canned Tomatoes Canned foods allow you to enjoy your favourite vegetables throughout the year. However, if you are concerned about your health, avoid canned food, especially canned tomatoes. The cans used to pack tomatoes and other foods are lined with a product called bisphenol A, BPA an endocrine disruptor that may mimic or disrupt hormones and increase the risk for breast cancer, prostate cancer, prostate cancer, early puberty metabolic disorders, infertility, and several other problems. When it comes to canned foods, canned tomatoes are more harmful to your health due to their high acidity which allows the BPA from the can lining to soak into tomatoes easily. Be safe and avoid cans.

"It Seems To Me That I Have Contracted Hiv With This Encounters, Am So Scared - Health - Nairaland";"LazyGoat";"Good day nairalanders, am dying silently and I seriously need advise. I'm so sorry for my long episode but I just thought I should explain everything out. Also sorry for my poor English, am typing in so much hurry. There is this girl i met on Facebook, she was the one that sent me a friend request though, so after about 4 day's of chatting i requested to see her and she agreed, we saw that same day because i went to see her at her place, the next day i went to see her also at her place, she lives with her mum ""her mum only child"" i don't know her compound or gate though because she normally comes to meet me at the road side whenever i comes to her. all this while i normally calls her every evening just to check up on her, on the 3rd day during the evening i went to see her at her place as usual, when i was about leaving she said she wants to know my place, so i agreed and we entered Keke and i showed her my place, when it was almost 11pm i asked her if she isn't going home and she said no that she wants to sleep over ""my heart stated beating faster"" because i was happy and was very sure i must have sex with her during the night, that night i tried severally to touch her but she refused so i had to let her sleep in peace, the next day morning she saw on my face that i wasn't happy and yes i wasn't all what was on my mind was for her to get up from the bed and take her leave, i was still lying on the bed when suddenly she started touching me all over. Then i responded and we had sex i had condoms but the urge within me couldn't allow me go out from the bed to get it, to be sincere not just that only. I really wanted to enter her raw because it's been long i felt how it feels like. When i was done i saw thick bloods all over my bed sheet, when i saw it i was shocked and was wondering where it came from, immediately i took my touch light phone switched on the touch and pointed it on my dick and i was surprised that i saw blood all over my dick, the blood has an unpleasant ordour, it was smelling so badly that i couldn't breadth, i confronted the girl and told her that she is on her period and she didn't tell me, and allowed me to have sex with her raw she suddenly became afraid and thought i wanted to slap her but I had no such intentions. The only thing on my mind at that moment was the fear of hiv, she told me she wasn't on her period and din't knew where and how the blood came from her, i was so scared to the bone that i must have contracted hiv my fear became worsen when i remembered she din't asked me to use a condom when i was about going down on her, nor did she complained when i went down on her even without any form of pre-intimacy or kissing. I was so scared that i had to give her the last money i had on me which is 1500. I pleaded with her to go to one private trusted medical facility not too far from my place, i told her to do hiv text and come back with the result and show me so she took the money and left, 4 minutes later she came back to my place that she forgot her charger that she wants to collect it, i told her to go and do the test that when she is back she will collect her charger but she insisted that her battery is low and she wants to charge her phone on the place that the test is to be conducted,  i allowed her take it and she left, about two minutes later it occurred to me to follow her and sees where she is going so i wore my trouser immediately and i did but to my surprise she is going the opposite direction ""she was going home"" so i pursued her and took the money from her i was so angry and pissed off that i din't gave her transport. I didn't called her throughout that day all what was on my head is that i have contracted hiv i was so scared to the bone, that same evening i called her and asked her about her whereabout and she told me she is at home so i went to her place and she came to meet me at the usual road side that we normally meet, i pleaded with her to do this text just to put my mind at rest but her response is that she doesn't have hiv that am making her scared, i asked her how she knew she doesn't have hiv and she was silent i asked her this same question up to 4 times but she couldn't say a word. I tried all i could to convince her to do this text but she refused so i had to let her be and face my sorrows alone two day's later she came to my place one thing led to the other and we had sex but this time i used a condom, we had sex severally for up to one week but i was always on condom, ""I have a very very high libido, so i couldn't resist whenever she is around me"" but still the first encounter i had with her was still fresh on my memory and eating me up, i lost weight because of thinking and i couldn't go to work for about a week, during same period my scrountom balls became very painful that i couldn't sleep at night so i went to a local text lab in my area to do some texts i did gonorrhea, syphilis, clymadia and all came out negative. Two days later the pains went away, during this period i was unable to sleep i thought i had contracted hiv i was so restless that i had to go back to the lab to take an hiv text, deep down within me i knew it would be negative because it is just 2weeks since i got exposed, but still i wanted to do it to put my mind at rest a little and had some little hope, the text came back negative, i had to explain to the lab guy what am going through and he told me i made a mistake that i shouldn't have told her that it was hiv text am about conducting on her that i should have told her that it is blood text to know her blood group, and i picked up the idea and decided to use it, I told the lab guy that am coming with her the next day. On same evening i went to the girl place and told her that i did hiv text and it was negative i showed her my result, i told her that she doesn't have hiv and my mind is finally at rest, she was happy. I then told her that i want us to do blood text next day to know our blood group if we are both compatible and she concurred, next day i took her to the lab the lab guy already knew my plan, he asked us what text did we came for and i told him it is blood text, he then called me into the inner room put a small piece of cotton wool on my hand and told me to hold it that way in other for the girl to believe he has took my blood, the girl went and he drew her blood he ran the hiv text on her as we both planned earlier. He told us to come next day for the result, few hours later i went alone because i knew the result normally comes between minutes/hours he gave me the result and it was negative. My mind finally came down all symptoms, worries and fears i had been experiencing suddenly disappeared, since that day until this moment i have been having raw sex with her, i would call it a painful sex because there are sores all over my dick accompanied with blood, i start noticing that since i started having raw sex with her, but unfortunately my sexual urge is just too high that i have been ignoring it and still continuing, and ignoring the pains which is indeed very painful because of the sores on my dick. Until 6 days ago i became very sick, serious headache, mid grade fever, painful eye's, appitite loss, dizziness, serious diarrha ""the most serious i have ever experienced all my life"" i have been so scared, because the last time i fell sick was March 2012 since then i haven't in anyway fallen sick. So i was really so scared that i have contracted hiv because the lab i conducted her hiv text was a local lab i was scared that the result is false. 4days ago i went to do some text for malaria and typhoid and the text came out that i have a lots of typhoid and a single + for malaria. I bought drugs took injection but still the symptoms are still there am still feeling so sick am so scared and confused right now as the symptoms has refused to go even after taking drugs and injections. I planned taking her for another hiv text at a government hospital tomorrow, if this eventually comes out negative I will never go in raw again, I have learnt my lessons already. I'm not myself anymore am so confused, i can't eat, sleep nor can I explain what am passing through right now to anyone. I'm so confused and feels like am dying slowly, please I need advise on what to do or next step to take because am dying silently.t go to work for about a week, during same period my scrountom balls became very painful that i couldnt go to work for about a week, during same period my scrountom balls became very painful that i couldn";" 1180 ";"LazyGoat"

Gallstones without symptoms do not usually require an operation.If you decide not to go ahead with surgery or your individual risks from an operation are too high you may wish to adopt a watch and wait approach under your surgeon or GP’s supervision which is occasionally successful.  In the past medication and shock waves were tried to dissolve stones but was not usually successful, especially as the gallbladder may not work correctly and stones re-occur.If you choose not to have this procedure, symptoms related to your gallbladder/gallstones may continue, deteriorate or cause life-threatening complications.

Do this exercise a couple times per day. These exercises will take no time to strengthen your control muscles. 3.    You need to practice. When you masturbate and are about to cum, try to hold it back. Second, when you need to pee start peeing and when you are half way done STOP for a second then start.

"What To Know About Lung Cancer - Health - Nairaland";"HealthSmart";"Lung cancer is a condition that causes cells to divide in the lungs uncontrollably. This causes the growth of tumors that reduce a person's ability to breathe.According to the Centers for Disease Control, 218,527 people in the United States received a lung cancer diagnosis in 2015. Early diagnosis can help a person seek treatment, as early as possible, in the disease's course.Identifying lung cancer in its earliest stages can be difficult, however, because the symptoms may be similar to those of a respiratory infection, or there may be no symptoms at all.In this article, we explain the nature of lung cancer, how to recognize the symptoms, and the ways doctors treat lung cancer before it becomes life-threatening.What is lung cancer?Lung cancer causes mutations in cells.Cancer causes certain mutations in otherwise healthy cells.Typically, the body programs cells to die at a certain stage in their life cycle to avoid overgrowth. Cancer overrides this instruction, causing cells to grow and multiply when they should not.The overgrowth of cells leads to the development of tumors and the harmful effects of cancer.In lung cancer, this pattern of cell overgrowth occurs in the lungs, which are vital organs for breathing and gas exchange.Doctors typically diagnose two lung cancer types, small cell and non-small cell, depending on how they appear under a microscope. A person is more likely to have non-small cell lung cancer than small cell.While anyone can develop lung cancer, cigarette smoking and exposure to smoke can increase the likelihood that a person will experience the condition. Lung cancer can develop if a person has a history of exposure to inhaled chemicals or other toxins.Even if this exposure to chemicals and other toxins was a long time ago, it could cause changes in lung cells that lead to cancer.SymptomsIn people with lung cancer, symptoms do not always occur until the condition has reached a later stage.However, some people may notice symptoms, which they may think are related to a less serious, acute illness.Examples of these symptoms include:appetite losschanges to a person's voice, such as hoarsenessfrequent chest infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonialingering cough that may start to get worseshortness of breathunexplained headachesweight losswheezingA person may also experience more severe symptoms associated with lung cancer.

"7 Tips To Keep Your Kidneys Healthy - Health - Nairaland";"prof2007";"The kidneys are fist-sized organs located at the bottom of the rib cage on both sides of your spine. They perform several functions, including filtering waste products, excess water and other impurities from the blood. These waste products are then stored in the bladder and later expelled through urine.In addition, the kidneys regulate the pH, salt and potassium levels in the body. They also produce hormones that regulate blood pressure and control the production of red blood cells. The kidneys are also responsible for activating a form of vitamin D that helps the body absorb calcium for building bones and regulating muscle function.Sadly, kidney disease is one of the world’s major public health problems and more than 100,000 new cases are recorded annually in Nigeria, according to data from the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan. Also, statistics from the Nigerian Association of Nephrology showed that 25 million Nigerians are suffering from kidney failure, meaning a condition where the kidney can no longer work without dialysis or transplant.Therefore, maintaining kidney health is important to your overall health and general well-being. By keeping your kidneys healthy, the body will filter and expel waste properly and produce hormones to help your body function properly.Here are some tips to keep your kidneys healthy.1. BE ACTIVE AND FIT Regular exercise is good for more than just your waistline. It can lower the risk of chronic kidney disease. It can also reduce your blood pressure and boost your heart health, which are both important in preventing kidney damage. You don’t have to run marathons to reap the reward of exercise. Walking, running, cycling and even dancing are great for your health. Find any activity that keeps you busy and have fun. It will be easier to stick to it and have great results.2. CONTROL YOUR BLOOD SUGAR People with diabetes or a condition that causes high blood sugar may develop kidney damage. When your body’s cells can’t use the glucose (sugar) in your blood, your kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter your blood. Over years of exertion, this can lead to life-threatening damage. However, if you can control your blood sugar, you reduce the risk of damage. Also, if the damage is caught early, your doctor can take steps to reduce or prevent additional damage.3. MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE High blood pressure can cause kidney damage. If high blood pressure occurs with other health issues like diabetes, heart disease or high cholesterol, the impact on your body can be significant. A healthy blood pressure reading is 120/80. Pre-hypertension is between that point and 139/89. Lifestyle and dietary changes may help lower your blood pressure at this point.If your blood pressure readings are consistently above 140/90, you may have high blood pressure. You should talk with your doctor about monitoring your blood pressure regularly, making changes to your lifestyle and possibly taking medication.4. MONITOR YOUR WEIGHT AND EAT A HEALTHY DIET People who are overweight or obese are at risk for a number of health conditions that can damage the kidneys. These include diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. A healthy diet that’s low in sodium, processed meats, and other kidney-damaging foods may help reduce risk of kidney damage. Focus on eating fresh ingredients that are naturally low-sodium, such as cauliflower, blueberries, fish, whole grains, and more.5. DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS There’s no magic behind the cliché advice to drink 8 glasses of water a day, but it’s a good goal precisely because it encourages you to stay hydrated. Regular, consistent water intake is healthy for your kidneys. Water helps clear sodium and toxins from your kidneys. It also lowers your risk of chronic kidney disease.Aim to drink at least 1.5 to 2 litres of water in a day. Exactly how much water you need depends largely on your health and lifestyle. Factors like climate, exercise, gender, overall health and whether or not you’re pregnant or breastfeeding are important to consider when planning your daily water intake.People who have previously had kidney stones should drink a bit more water to help prevent stone deposits in the future.6. DON'T SMOKE Smoking damages your body’s blood vessels. This leads to slower blood flow throughout your body and to your kidneys. Smoking also puts your kidneys at an increased risk of cancer. If you stop smoking, your risk will drop. However, it will take many years to return to the risk level of a person who has never smoked.7. BE CAREFUL OF EXCESSIVE INTAKE OF CERTAIN DRUGS If you regularly take over-the-counter pain medications, you may be causing damage to your kidneys gradually. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen can damage your kidneys if you take them regularly for chronic pain, headache or arthritis. People with no kidney issues who take the medicine occasionally are likely safe. However, talk with your doctor about kidney-safe treatments if you feel pain regularly.Also, remember to have regular kidney tests, especially if you are obese; over 60 years old, or if your family has a history of high blood pressure.Source: https://punchng.com/seven-tips-to-keep-the-kidney-healthy/";" 100 ";"prof2007"

"5 Common Signs Of Infertility In Women - Health - Nairaland";"NairalandDoctor";"Common Signs of Infertility in Women1. Irregular periodsThe average woman’s cycle is 28 days long. But anything within a few days of that can be considered normal, as long as those cycles are consistent. For example, a woman who has a 33-day cycle one month, a 31-day cycle the next, and a 35-day cycle after that, is probably having “normal” periods.But a woman whose cycles vary so greatly that she can’t even begin to estimate when her period might arrive is experiencing irregular periods. This can be related to hormone issues, or to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Both of these can contribute to infertility.2. Painful or heavy periodsMost women experience cramps with their periods. But painful periods that interfere with your daily life may be a symptom of endometriosis.3. No periodsIt’s not uncommon for women to have an off month here and there. Factors like stress or heavy workouts can cause your period to temporarily disappear. But if you haven’t had a period in months, it’s time to get your fertility checked.4. Symptoms of hormone fluctuationsSigns of hormone fluctuations in women could indicate potential issues with fertility. Talk to your doctor if you experience the following:skin issuesreduced sex drivefacial hair growththinning hairweight gain5. Pain during sexSome women have experienced painful sex their entire lives, so they’ve convinced themselves it’s normal. But it’s not. It could be related to hormone issues, to endometriosis, or to other underlying conditions that could also be contributing to infertility.₦airalandDoctor ";" 116 ";"NairalandDoctor"

She received her medical degree at Rutgers University in New jersey and her Masters of Public Health at John Hopkins University-Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Shitta-Bey is an actively practicing Obstetrician Gynecologist in the United States and has been trained in minimally invasive surgery.She is a fellow of the American college of Obstetrician Gynecologists as well as a member of the American Association of Gynecologic laparoscopists. Dr. Shitta-Bey believes in the empowerment of the community that one serves. Currently, minimally invasive surgical procedures are rare in the Nigerian health sector and the pool of surgeons that practice these procedures are small. In Dr. Shitta-bey’s vision, all practising surgeons in Nigeria become competent in their ability to operate laparoscopically.Dr. Shitta-bey has been active in the Nigerian healthcare system since 2003. She has worked in numerous places in the North, south and west of Nigeria. The decision to open up this center was formed by her observation, during numerous medical missions in Nigeria, that a lot of the procedures including basic laparoscopic procedures could not be reproduced by Nigerian surgeons.Dr. Shitta-bey believes that education is power, and in the 21st century, every surgeon or ob/gyn physician be they work in a small tiny private clinic or a big tertiary care center, should be able to do basic bread and butter procedures laparoscopically.She believes every general surgeon should be able to do a laparoscopic appendectomy and cholecystectomy while an obstetrician gynecologist should be able to do a laparoscopic tubal ligation, oophorectomy and hysteroscopic ablation and myomectomy. Dr. Shitta-bey believes in the international standard of healthcare and believes that now is the time for Nigerian surgeons to join the ranks of their colleagues in providing healthcare meant for the 21st century.Dr. Shitta-bey is happily married. She enjoys reading and traveling. Her favorite area to travel is the Caribbean islands and if she is not working in Nigeria or the US, she most likely would be found there.

"Pelvic Pain In Women. - Health - Nairaland";"MIsurgical";"Pelvic pain is more common in women. There are many different causes of pain in your pelvis. They can be separated by when they tend to happen, if you are pregnant and if they are accompanied by other symptoms such as vaginal bleeding. The most common causes are mentioned below. Most will improve with painkillers. Most recurring causes have treatments available.The pelvis is the lowest part of your tummy (abdomen). Organs in your pelvis include your bowel, bladder, womb (uterus) and ovaries. Pelvic pain usually means pain that starts from one of these organs. In some cases the pain comes from your pelvic bones that lie next to these organs, or from nearby muscles, nerves, blood vessels or joints. So, there are many causes of pelvic pain.Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men. This leaflet will deal with the most common causes of pelvic pain in women.Pelvic pain can be acute or chronic. Acute means that it is the first time you have had this type of pain. Chronic means that pain has been a problem for a long time - more than six months.What are the causes of pregnancy-related pelvic pain?Miscarriage: miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy at any time up to the 24th week. 7 or 8 miscarriages out of 10 occur before 13 weeks of pregnancy. The usual symptoms of miscarriage are vaginal bleeding and lower tummy (abdominal) or pelvic cramps. You may then pass some tissue from the vagina, which often looks like a blood clot. See the separate leaflet called Miscarriage and Bleeding in Early Pregnancy for more details.Ectopic pregnancy: an ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that tries to develop outside the womb (uterus). Usual symptoms include pain on one side of the lower abdomen or pelvis. It may develop sharply, or may slowly become worse over several days. It can become severe. Vaginal bleeding often occurs, but not always. It is often darker-coloured than the bleeding of a period. See the separate leaflet called Ectopic Pregnancy for more details.Number of pregnancies where an ectopic pregnancy occurs[/b]7Source: Ectopic Pregnancy[b]Rupture of corpus luteum cyst: a corpus luteum makes hormones that help keep you pregnant, until other organs such as the placenta take over. It forms after the release of the egg at ovulation. They are often found, by chance, when you have an ultrasound scan for whatever reason. They often cause no problems at all and clear up without treatment. Sometimes it can become too swollen and may burst. This may cause sharp pain on one side of your pelvis. If you have pain in your pelvis in the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy, see your doctor.Premature labou[/b]r: normally labour starts after 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Normal labour usually starts as tightenings felt across the lower abdomen. These become stronger, more painful and closer together. You may also have a 'show'. This is the mucous plug from the neck of the womb (cervix). If you have a gush of fluid from the vagina, your waters may have broken. You should contact your midwife immediately. If you have pelvic pains that come and go in a regular pattern, contact your midwife for advice. See the separate leaflet called Premature Labour for more details.[b]Placental abruption: rarely (about 6 times in every 1,000 deliveries), the placenta detaches from the wall of the womb. Before 24 weeks of pregnancy this is a miscarriage; however, after 24 weeks it is called an abruption. When it happens it is an emergency. This is because the baby relies on the placenta for food and oxygen. Without a working placenta, the baby will die. The staff in the maternity department will quickly try to deliver the baby. This is usually by emergency caesarean section.Do you Have Pelvic Pain Issues ? Pls visit Us at 33f Oba Akinjobi Street, GRA Ikeja, Lagos Tel: 08177788224www.miss.com.ng";" 203 ";"MIsurgical"

"The Right Treatment For Your Diabetes - Health - Nairaland";"Healthyway15";"Diabetes is a condition that impairs the body's ability to process blood glucose otherwise known as Blood Sugar. This is a condition whereby the body fails to utilize the ingested glucose properly, this may be due to lack of the hormone insulin or because the insulin that is available is not working effectively. This causes sugars to build up in the blood. Most of the food we eat everyday, are carbohydrates, and end in glucose or sugar for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose to get into the cells of our bodies. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood. Types of Diabetes Type 1 is the most severe form of the disease. your body does not produce enough insulin. It usually develops in children and teenagers. But people of all ages can develop Type 1 diabetes.Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes, and it means that your body doesn't use insulin properly. With type 2 diabetes, your body does not use insulin properly. There may be decrease in insulin secretion, or their muscle and adipose cells may be resistant to the effects of insulin, resulting in a decreased ability of these cells to take up and metabolize glucose. Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant woman's cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy. Women who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during their pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes. In all cases, the levels of glucose in the blood increase, causing Hyperglycemia (High blood sugar). As glucose accumulates in the blood, excess levels of this sugar are excreted in the urine. Because of greater amounts of glucose in the urine, more water is excreted with it, causing an increase in urinary volume and frequency of urination as well as thirst. Symptoms of Diabetes Unusual Hunger and thirst, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss, sexual dysfunction, extreme fatigue and weakness, blurred vision, sores that don't heal or heal slowly, headache, urinary tract infections. Complications Early treatment of Diabetes is important so as to prevent the following conditions : heart disease and heart attack, vision loss, neuropathy, hearing loss, foot damage that could eventually lead to amputation, kidney failure, dementia. In order to keep your blood sugar levels steady, try to eat small meals throughout the day. Emphasize healthy foods such as:fruits, vegetables, whole grainslean protein such as poultry and fishhealthy fats such as olive oil and nuts.Treatment of Diabetes It is widely treated with injections and drugs prescribed by doctors. But over the last few years, diabetes has become difficult to treat completely. That's why it's now being managed today by most diabetic patients rather than getting cured completely.

"Top 8 Tips To Overcome Depression In 2019 - Health - Nairaland";"AdebisiAdeyinka";"Top 8 tips to overcome depression in 2019The rate of suicide is becoming alarming these days and one of the leading cause of suicide is depression. Before a man can ever think of suicide, there must be something that is bothering his mind which eventually make him to think of killing himself.Depression is a state of deep sadness and grief, however this is very common among both the youths and even the adults nowadays, and this has led to the death of many through committing suicide and developing hypertension.However, before you die of depression or attempt to commit suicide — which is a grievous offence to humanity, why not try these eight ways to overcome depression?1. Avoid loneliness and never stay idle: There is a popular aphorism that says, “An idle mind is the workshop of devil ” once you are not doing anything, different thoughts will begin to struggle for survival in your mind. You will begin to think about what you shouldn’t think about; thought about your Ex that left, a relative that died, a friend that left your life. Once you have something tangible that you are doing, you won’t be bothered about things that have passed. You should understand life is not meant to be sweet and rosy, so you need to move on by doing something reasonable than listening to the chants of silence or staying in a lonely place.2. Get a friend: You should have someone you share your problems with when life hit you like bomb. A problem shared is a problem solved. God won’t come from heaven to solve your problems. If you find yourself in a very difficult situation, you need to get a good friend you share it with. No one is an island of knowledge. We were created for one another in order to get our problems solved.3. Watch TV and listen to music when you are bored:Instead of allowing boredom to lead you to depression why not get yourself entertained? Why must you always be cold when you can set yourself on fire of funs. Once you notice that you’re getting too depressed about an issue maybe relating to relationship, marriage or failure in your study; why not relax yourself, then watch TV, listen to music and watch comic clips to get yourself out of those thoughts. You can be free from depression, if the cause of your depression is loneliness or heartbreak.4. Find peace within yourself and accept life as it comes: You might be depressed just because you have been unable to meet your aspirations or desirable goals. But you need to ease yourself out of worry by finding peace within yourself. Always understand the fact that life is not meant to be smooth — messes are meant to happen. In fact, life is not a bed of roses, so when life hit you hard like thunderstorm, you don’t need to over react, rather accept it as it comes. Every problem as a solution so find joy and peace, then look for the solution to your problems.5. Do not compare yourself to others: Comparing yourself to others may lead to depression when you find out that such person is doing better than you. The best way to avoid this is by focusing on your dream and passion. Let your passion drive you and not your emotion. When you see others shining than you, that doesn’t mean you won’t also shine someday. You need to start erasing the thought of comparing yourself to others in order to prevent being depressed about other’s achievements.6 Find a work, stay out of poverty: Poverty is one of the leading cause of depression and you need to get rid of it to stay out of depression. The reason why you are depressed may be because you do not have money, and money doesn’t come if you are not working. So start doing something that will get you out of poverty so you can lead a life without depression.7. Avoid friends that make you feel bad: There are friends whose presence in your life does not give you peace, joy and comfort. You need to avoid such kind of friends. There are friends that won’t encourage you about your goals and dreams, you need to stay away from them. More so, you need to stay away from a relationship that doesn’t give you peace.8. Connect with God and believe in Him: It is of no doubt that many of us do not believe in a supernatural being, but it is essential of us to place our believe on something. As humans, it is only what we believe in that works for us, if we do not believe in God, we won’t get our problems solved through Him. So when you start having a grievous feeling toward something, you need to place your believe on a supernatural being. He is the only one who is capable of solving countless of problems.For this and more, visit the blog link below:https://bidemiblog.com/2019/12/featured/8-tips-on-how-to-overcome-depression/";" 42 ";"AdebisiAdeyinka"

"What Paresthesia (paja Paja) Is All About And Why You Experience It - Health - Nairaland";"michaelo2";"What Is Paresthesia? If you’ve ever felt as though your skin was crawling, or had numbness or itching for no apparent reason, you may have experienced paresthesia.Almost everyone has experienced paresthesia on one occasion or the other. One of the most common times people get that familiar feeling of pins and needles is when their arms or legs “fall asleep.” This sensation usually occurs because you’ve inadvertently put pressure on a nerve.It resolves once you change your position to remove the pressure from the affected nerve. This type of paresthesia is temporary and usually resolves without treatment. If the paresthesia persists, you may have an underlying medical disorder that requires immediate treatment.What are the symptoms of paresthesia?Paresthesia can affect any part of the body, but it commonly affects the:hands, arms, legs, feet.It can be temporary or chronic. The symptoms can include feelings of:* numbness* weakness* tingling* burning* coldChronic paresthesia may cause a stabbing pain. That may lead to clumsiness of the affected limb. When paresthesia occurs in your legs and feet, it can make it difficult to walk.See your doctor if you have symptoms of paresthesia that persist or affects your way of life. It could be a sign that you have an underlying medical condition that needs treatment.What causes paresthesia?It’s not always possible to determine the cause of paresthesia. Temporary paresthesia is often due to pressure on a nerve or brief periods of poor circulation.This can happen when you fall asleep on your hand or sit with your legs crossed for too long. Chronic paresthesia may be a sign of nerve damage.Other possible causes of neuropathy include:* Trauma * Repetitive  movement injuries* Autoimmune  diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis* Neurological  diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis.* Kidney  diseases* Liver  diseases* Stroke * Tumors  in the brain or near nerves* Bone  marrow or connective tissue disorders* Hypothyroidism * Deficiencies  in vitamin B-1, B-6, B-12, E, or niacin* Getting  too much vitamin D* Infections , such as Lyme disease, shingles, or HIV* Certain  medications, such as chemotherapy drugs* Exposure  to toxic substances, such as chemicals or heavy metals* Nerve damage can eventually lead to permanent numbness or paralysis.Who is at risk for paresthesia?Anyone can experience temporary paresthesia. Your risk of nerve damage increases with age. You also may be more prone to it if you:* Perform  repetitive movements that repeatedly compress your nerves, such as typing, playing an instrument, or playing a sport such as tennis.* Drink  heavily and eat a poor diet that leads to vitamin deficiencies, specifically vitamin B-12 and foliate. * Have  type 1 or 2 diabetes. * Have  an autoimmune condition. * Have  a neurological condition, such as Multiple Sclerosis. How is paresthesia diagnosed?See your doctor if you have persistent paresthesia with no obvious cause.Be prepared to give your medical history. Mention any activities you participate in that involve repetitive movement.You should also list any over-the-counter or prescription medications that you take.Your doctor will consider your known health conditions to help them make a diagnosis.If you have diabetes, for example, your doctor will want to determine if you have nerve damage, or neuropathy.Your doctor will probably perform a full physical exam. This will likely include a neurological exam as well.Blood work and other laboratory tests, such as a spinal tap, may help them rule out certain diseases.If your doctor suspects there’s a problem with your neck or spine, they may recommend imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans.Depending on the results, they may refer you to a specialist, such as a neurologist, orthopedist, or endocrinologist.What is the treatment for paresthesia?Treatment depends on the cause of your paresthesia. It may be possible to treat your condition by eliminating the cause in some cases.For example, if you have a repetitive movement injury, a few lifestyle adjustments or physical therapy may solve the problem.If your paresthesia is due to an underlying disease, getting treatment for that disease can potentially ease the symptoms of paresthesia.Your individual circumstances will determine whether your symptoms will improve. Some types of nerve damage are irreversible.What should  people with paresthesia expect?Temporary paresthesia usually resolves within a few minutes.You may have a case of chronic paresthesia if those strange sensations don’t go away or they come back far too often. It can complicate your daily life if the symptoms are severe. That’s why it’s so important to try to find the cause.Don’t hesitate to seek a second opinion or see a specialist if necessary.The severity of chronic paresthesia and how long it will last largely depends on the cause. In some cases, treating the underlying condition solves the problem.Be sure to tell your doctor if your treatment isn’t working so they can adjust your treatment plan.How can you prevent paresthesia?Paresthesia isn’t always preventable. For instance, you probably can’t help it if you tend to fall asleep on your arms.You can take steps to reduce the occurrence or severity of paresthesia, though.For example, using wrist splints at night may alleviate the compression of the nerves of your hand and help resolve the symptoms of paresthesia you experience at night.Follow these tips for preventing chronic paresthesia:* Avoid repetitive movement if possible.* Rest often if you need to perform repetitive movements.* Get up and move around as often as possible if you have to sit for long periods.* If you have diabetes or any other chronic disease, careful monitoring and disease management will help lower your chances of having paresthesia.Please do share, HEALTH THIS MOMENT CARES.https://www.healththismoment.com/2018/08/what-paresthesia-paja-paja-is-all-about.html?m=1";" 46067 ";"michaelo2"
"Excessive Suffering From Anxiety Disorder - Health - Nairaland";"SimplySincere";"Good evening everyone. It all started when I was graduating from pry school to secondary school two decades ago,I started developing some anxiety issues which was due to the fact that i was enrolled in a secondary school i actually detested.speaking to people in a formal settings and facing crowds becomes a major issue for me as my heart races abnormally.i thought this condition would return back to normal as days go by,however, it becomes more and more complicated. I've so far visited two different psychiatrists/psychologists who recommended  several tests.All test results came out normal after which i was advised to go for the CBT with regular intake of prescribed drugs.With CBT and regular drug intake, no positive result recorded so far since June 2019.Downloaded and read several books online on how well to manage anxiety issues, but all efforts yield no results.The devastating part is that at the point of receiving interview invite I become extremely anxious, and worst of it all is I get panicky with shaky voices at the interview stage.went for an interview with a commercial bank 4 years ago after my NYSC but my performance was woeful as my brain went blank.I cried for weeks though eventually i got a job.my challenge now is switching job from the current engagement to a new one.I recently went for an interview with a big organisation, I was tensed all through,was sweating, shaking and my responses to interviewer questions were incoherent. Felt disappointed, embarrassed and extremely bad this is happening to me and i have decided not to go for any interview for now. Professionals in the house please is there a means i can get out of this mental ailment or is there anyone with this same mental condition who has found cure.Thank you";" 242 ";"SimplySincere"

"My Experience At Apata General Hospital Ibadan - Health - Nairaland";"heldworld";"I was weak, tired and sick altogether, left my home as as early as 8pm on Monday morning, with the mindset of beating the traffic congestion to the closest general hospital at a far distance from my home - Apata General Hospital, Ibadan. I knew with the kind of health complaints i had, i would need a test conducted on me, ""well, i need a doctor's recommendation on that first"", i said to myself. So i decided to see the doctor first.Entering the Hospital, i have to get my file first, ""Hello, good morning, this is my card i need to see the doctor""""is this your first time here?"" a female voice from the record room""No, although it has been a while i came here"", i replied""okay, you'll have to pay to the account dept first""""alright, kindly show me the account dept"" i requested. She pointed in the direction and i went there, paid 200 naira and collected a receipt, then back to the record room. ""have your seat I'll attend to you"" she said. Okay, after about 15 minutes she requested both the card and the receipt then returned both after tearing a part of the receipt and using my card to find my file. I was then told to sit on a queue and wait for my name to be called by the doctor, it was almost 10:00am.I have got about 6 patients before me, it wasn't a big deal until i had to wait and move closer to the consultation room on the seat until i heard the doctor call my name 2:10pm.Is this how people get attended to here? I thought my suffering was over, not knowing I've just seen season one.I explained the symptoms of my illness to the doctor and he recommended i have a blood test first. Getting to the laboratory department, they said they can no longer obtain a sample for the day and I will have to come back the following day. I asked if it was possible that the sample is drawn and i can just come for the result the following morning. I was told that is not possible. I will have to come back to give the sample 8:00am the following day. I was left with no choice, so i had to go back 8:00am on Tuesday ""Hi. I was told to come back this morning for a medical test""I handed her the leaflet from the doctor. ""okay, it's 1500 naira, and you'll have to purchase a glove and a needle from the pharmacy""I quickly did that, ""here is the glove and the needle"", i said. ""okay, have your seat while we obtain your blood sample"" - she replied.The blood sample was obtained and i was told to come back  12 noon for the result.Chai! will i have to waste half of a whole day here again?The lab attendant saw the look on my face and told me - ""just hang-around and come back around that time"". Had to wait around and went back for my result 12 noon.""Hi, am back for my result"" - i said""have your seat, it will soon be ready"" - she replied So, this result isn't even ready at 12 noon. The test result was finally issued after 45 more minutes.Dashed again to the Records room, explained and got my card to the doctor's office within 30more minutes. And that was almost 1:30pm.Those on the queue for the day were already tired and lamenting the queue wasnt moving at all.There were two doctors inside, one that attended to me the previous day and another doctor.After some minutes the doctor that attended to me the previous day left and there was just one doctor in the consultation room.""Why are you standing there?"" - He asked""I need to see a doctor sir"" - i replied""i have been here yesterday and was told by the doctor to go for a medical test, so am back with the result"" - i further explained""when was the test conducted?"" - he asked""the sample was taken 8:00am today and I was told to come for the result 12:00 noon, i just collected the test result, that's why i am here to see the doctor now sir"" - i explained again""they couldn't have said that, if you have been here earlier you would have been attended to"" - he said""but that was what i was told"" - i replied""You think those on the seats are fools?, i will make sure no one attends to you today, what is your name and give me your file""i gave him my file and he immediately kept the file under some of the books on his table""Go and stand outside, no one will attend to you today"" - he screamed. I had to just leave the premises in annoyance, frustration and unattended-to after all the sufferings.If this is what has become of our medical care system, am afraid we are sitting on a time bomb because there are infections, diseases and sicknesses that are killing patients under the skin quietly and require urgent attention else the patient dies a quick painful death. Are these the hands we have on deck? Our Governors need to act fast!

"3 Health Tips For The Harmattan Season - Health - Nairaland";"gideonjeta";"Slowly we are transitioning into that season characterised by cool, dust-laden wind and extreme dryness. The harmattan which occurs between the end of November and the middle of March can be very harsh to one’s health.Our bodies note the weather changes and react accordingly. Some of the effects of the harmattan include dry skin (because of the obvious loss of moisture), cracked lips, sole of the feet and even the skin itself (cracks even become ulcerated).Below are three health tips to keep in mind during the harmattan season.Stay HydratedThis is probably the most important tip on this list. Drink a lot of water even if you have to carry around a bottle of water.Steer clear of caffeinated beverages such as coffee and even tea because they are diuretics and diuretics increase the excretion of water from bodies.Eat A Lot Of FruitsFruits are rich in vitamins and minerals that would keep your body healthy during the harmattan season.It is advised to eat fruits rich in vitamin C such as mango, papaya, pineapple, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries, watermelon, guavas, bell peppers, kiwifruit, oranges, papayas, broccoli, tomatoes, kale.Skin CareThe skin is one of the first receptors of the harsh weather. The dryness in the atmosphere drains the skin of moisture. It is therefore important to regularly moisturizes the skin.Ensure to use an oil-based moisturizer such as vaseline, shea butter, coconut oil etc. Also, exfoliate your skin a few times a week to help shave off dead and dry skin cells and allow new skin cells to come up.https://www.nigerialog.com/health/3-health-tips-for-the-harmattan-season/new/#new";" 80 ";"gideonjeta"

"10 Foods For Harder Erections:  Natural Viagra Foods - Health - Nairaland";"markbor";"Being able to get a rock hard erection is the dream of many men, especially men in their 40s and 50s. Most men do fine when it comes to having a good erection but sometimes things don’t go so well down there.Sometimes you want to last just that little longer in bed and wish to have a long, sustained erection. If you’re struggling with getting or sustaining an erection then this article is all you need as it explains the science behind erection, foods for harder erections and some general tips as well.If you don’t really want to use supplements or drugs for achieving solid healthy erections, then try some natural Viagra foods that are scientifically proven to help your erections. So here they are:1. PomegranatesPomegranates have many benefits for men who want to achieve harder erections. Researchers from around the world are intrigued with the miraculous healing powers of this fruit.The thing that makes pomegranates a beneficial food for erections is its influence on testosterone production.  In addition, it also increases the nitric oxide production in the body and protects NO from other free radicals.2. SpinachSpinach truly is one of the best foods for harder erections for many reasons. Spinach has natural nitrates that convert into nitric oxide by the actions of the tongue and gut bacteria and nitric oxide is very important when it comes to erections. You can call spinach a natural steroid food because it is quite rich in phytoecdysteroids, like ecdysterone, which is beneficial for testosterone production.Spinach is also high in ecdysterone that in one study gave better results than anabolic steroids. All the ecdysterone gathered into the body supports natural testosterone production and helps men achieve harder erections. Spinach also has a rich number of vitamins and minerals needed for nitric oxide and testosterone production.3. BeetsBeets happen to be great for the heart, due to the fact they contain a massive amount of nitrates, which are compounds in the body that transform into nitric oxide.The more nitrates you consume through food, the higher the nitric oxide that is released into your circulation, and thankfully, beets contain considerable amounts of nitrates. This is the reason that beets are one of the best foods for harder erections.4. PorridgeA healthy diet and active lifestyle are the building blocks for great sex. Oats are good for you because they are good for your heart health, fill your belly and make you more energetic in bed.They are packed full of soluble fiber that will help to clear cholesterol leaving blood vessels smooth and healthy, allowing blood to flow easily. Porridge comes under the list of top foods for achieving harder erections.5. GarlicIt may make your breath stink a bit but it is an incredible sex food for men. Garlic functions as a nitric oxide booster and a potent NOS activator, which in turn increases blood flow to the penis leading to harder erections.Incorporating garlic in your diet has also been proven in human beings to be more powerful at decreasing blood pressure as compared to the majority of pharmaceutical options.And as you can imagine this is beneficial for harder erections, because high blood pressure can be one of the root causes of Erectile dysfunction.6. SaffronSaffron helps in healing the aches and pains of your body. It can make the body more sensitive to touch and feelings. This is also helpful in increasing the libido in men and women.Though a bit expensive, it is quite beneficial for erections and you should consider consuming it on a daily basis.7. Whole GrainsIt is easier to have a harder and powerful erection if you consume more good carbs. But understand that there are good carbs and bad carbs.The kind of carbs you get from sweets, candies etc. are bad for health and you don’t need them.But, the kinds you get from whole grains are good for your health and testosterone production too.8. BananasPeople with harder erections have healthier hearts. So you should eat bananas to get the potassium in the body which is a great way to improve heart health and blood circulation.Eating enough potassium will modulate sodium levels and stop them becoming too high and this, in turn, reduces the risks of heart problems.9. WineYou might be surprised to hear this but the truth is that wine helps in getting a harder erection. It is a great source of the antioxidant phytochemical resveratrol which opens the arteries by enhancing the production of nitric oxide.Nitric oxide expands the blood vessels and this is how Viagra works. But the key here is moderation. Wine, especially the red wine, when taken in moderation causes harder erections. Excess wine, however, will actually cause a decline in erection strength.10. WalnutsWalnuts are another one of the powerful foods for erections because they are incredibly high in arginine which will convert to Nitric Oxide which is crucial for strong erections.Other nuts also contain arginine but walnuts are the king when it comes to boosting the strength of erections.Another great way to improve erections is to do some exercises that work the stomach area as the increased blood flow to this area which is close to the penis will improve erections considerably.It is time that sex became satisfying for you. It is time that you could actually stay longer in your bedroom to get exactly what you desire and need from getting close with the woman that you love the most without having to depend on drugs or pills.For ADVANCED “Natural” Techniques to permanently cure your premature ejaculation and Ed once and for all, Call/Whatsapp 08023342859 or email irabormark@gmail.com  to download a Free report  titled “Natural Cure For Premature Ejaculation & Ed” Is this MONSTER Affecting your marriage?

"Nairalanders, Please Save An 11 Years Old Life - Health - Nairaland";"Academicwizman";"An 11 year old girl (my niece) needs serious medical help. She is a very intelligent girl who is a victim of circumstance beyond her control. I was informed two weeks ago by my brother that her child needs medical attention. I also had various challenges that I am facing. I sent some money to the father to take care of her not knowing that it is a very serious case. While travelling to Awka (Unizik) for my PhD programme, I decided to check on my brother at Sagamu to know the state of her daughter's health. What I saw was really devastating and I had no means to really help at this time. Medical doctors, nurses and well-wishers here, please help! I advised that we take her to hospital to no avail.  He has strong conviction that the hand will be cut off if medical attention is sought in hospital and opted for traditional treatment. Please help in saving a soul of the poor girl. Here are the pictures of the girl that I took this morning. The pictures are dark because I took it this morning before leaving for Awka. Nairalanders, save a soul.";" 230 ";"Academicwizman"

"A Study Just Reveals That Ladies Don't Change There Underwears Daily - Health - Nairaland";"9jabazeblog";"A strange but eye-opening study has revealed that 45% of adults do not change their briefs, panties, boxers or other forms of underwear after each wear. According to the research carried out by American underwear company, Tommy John, this is actually something that is common to men and women alike! Although men are [unsurprisingly] worse offenders than women, being 2.5 times more likely to wear their pants for a week on end, the result of the study still does not look so good on women who actually didn’t fare much better than men in the results.A representative for Tommy John tells Mail Online: “These results were split fairly evenly between men and women, which throws any theories out the window that women are more hygiene-conscious than men, or vice versa.”What’s perhaps the most shocking thing to be gleaned off this study is that 13% of the 1000 respondents actually admitted that they’d sported the same undies for seven days or more!The study of course focused on a completely-American audience and whether these stats would be significantly change or remain the same when applied to a Nigerian context is quite vague but of course, no one would particularly be shocked shocked if it actually turned out that these represents a close-enough depiction of how Nigerians use and manage [pun intended] their underwear.Source.....https://www.9jabazeblog.com.ng/2019/12/a-study-just-reveals-that-ladies-dont-change-there-underwears-daily.html?m=1";" 111 ";"9jabazeblog"

"4 Smart Ways To Prevent Fainting - Health - Nairaland";"Wearabletech";"I don’t know who told Africans that if a person faints, they should pour water on the person. Here is an incident that occurred one Saturday a few months ago, my friend, Oghenero, was being dressed and made up for her wedding. We were in a small, supposedly cozy hotel room. The members of the bridal train (10 ladies, including me) were getting dressed too, looking for shoes, eyeliner and the likes.“Make una open window na,”(let’s open the windows) I said, vigorously fanning myself to preserve my makeup.“The AC go dey escape.”(The cold air would escape) Ejiro’s sister, Oghenemairo retorted.“AC wen no dey blow. See as I dey sweat.”(‘’The AC isn’t working optimally. Look as am sweating’’)The look she threw me was quite threatening. Hmmm…I kept quiet o. I know as Oghenemairo body take dey hot, I no get her power.(I kept quiet.  I know how hot tempered Oghenemairo is, I didn’t not have the strength to argue with her)  A few minutes later, Oghenemairo started to fan her face with her blush brush. “Eye dey turn me o.” (My eyes are turning) she said.“You don chop so?”(‘’Have you eaten?’’) Her sister, the bride, asked.“Yes na. No be me and you chop together?” (‘’Yes, didn’t you and I eat together?’’)“Open window, this AC no dey work.” (open the windows, this AC isn’t working)I repeated.“Come no dey do nurse thing for here, I take Oghene beg you.” (stop all this your nursing procedures, I beg of you) Oghenemairo retorted.Almost immediately, she fell to the ground. She’d fainted.“Ahh…Mairo! Bring water! Bring water!” Someone shouted.I rushed to the windows and threw them open. It didn’t seem to be enough. So I asked for the help of one of the other ladies to bring her outside to the balcony.“What of the water?” Someone asked.“She doesn’t need water. She needs air.”When a person faints, especially in a crowded place, it is usually due to hypoxia (deficiency of oxygen in the brain). Another common cause is hypoglycemia; which would require the use of sugars for resuscitation. Splashing water over the person’s face, further deprives oxygen from been respired. It could cause suffocation.WHAT CAUSES SYNCOPE (FAINTING)?A sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure leads to fainting, often in reaction to a stressful trigger. Depending on the cause, this condition is uusually self-treatable as it doesn’t require any serious medical procedure for resuscitation. Exposing the patient to fresh air is the first step to resuscitation, create space and increase ventilation in the area around the person. Fainting is usually self-diagnosable, before the actual incidence; the patient would experience certain indications that such a thing is about to occur. However, it is worthy of that this warning signs and symptoms are usually ignored.WHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF FAINTING?The signs and symptoms vary depending on the individual; generally, the commonest signs as it applies to the whole body include: collapsing, light-headedness, dizziness, low blood pressure, fatigue, or sweating. Some signs are more specific to the circulatory system (Heart) example: rapid heart rate, palpitations, or slow heart rate, also common are: blurred vision, fear/anxiety, nausea, or pallor.HOW IS SYNCOPE PREVENTED? (PRECAUTIONS)Fainting can be prevented if you hid to the early warning signs such as dizziness, nausea, or sweaty palms. However, if you have had a history of a fainting spell and your cognisant of your body’s signals there is great chance of averting the situation.If you notice you are about to faint do the following:Move away from the crowded area immediately.Lie down straight away.Contract your limbs or cross your legs; these actions can increase venous blood return to the brain and shun further blood supply to limbs thereby preventing a drop in blood pressure and consequently cubing the fainting spell.Reflexively raise or brace up your legs in the air. This action can also reduce your chances of fainting by returning more blood to your brain and breathing centres of your body.If you are nurse, doctor or just a Good Samaritan attending to someone who has fainted:Help the person lie down and lift his or her legs up in the air. This will restore blood flow to the brain, and the person should quickly regain consciousness. The person should lie down for a little while afterwards.Continue reading.....   https://smaartcollections.com/how-to-manage-syncope-4-smart-ways-to-preven/";" 96 ";"Wearabletech"

But for some time now, people from all walks of life have been trooping to the town not to shop for these items but to seek healing for various eye challenges, including blindness.This follows the discovery of a medicine by a herbalist in the town, which has been acclaimed to cure all kinds of eye diseases, including the dreadful glaucoma, which medical doctors say has no cure.ObservationThe herbalist, 60-year-old Mr John Kofi Sackey, aka Odopee, is the proprietor of Odopee Herbal Research and Learning Centre at Mankessim.The Daily Graphic has visited the centre twice in the last two weeks and met many people receiving treatment.Unlike the orthodox solutions, which prescribe various forms of surgery and medication, the herbal solution was not applied directly on the eyes. Rather, the herbalist pours the liquid preparation onto a piece of dry wood, puts the wood in a small plastic container for the patient to watch with widely opened eyes for 10 minutes.The Daily Graphic also observed that the patients, most of them above 60 years, repeated the process three times a day.After exposing the eyes to the invisible rays of the drug, the patients are made to walk for some time.They rest for two or three hours and resume the treatment.Mr Sackey said some of the patients regained their sight on the first day of treatment.Health authoritiesThe Mfantseman Municipal Director of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Mr Martin Daanko, told the Daily Graphic last Wednesday that even though the drug had not undergone any scientific analysis, his personal observation at the herbal centre and the numerous testimonies of cured patients pointed to the efficacy of the herbal medicine.He said he was particularly happy that the medication was not applied directly on the eyes.Mr Daanko also commended Mr Sackey for procuring more than 30 licences, certificates, testimonials, citations and recommendations from recognised institutions, including the Traditional Medicine Practice Council of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Health Procurement Unit, signed by a former Deputy Minister of Health, Mr Robert Joseph Mettle-Nunoo.The Municipal Health Director, who visited the centre in the company of the Human Resource Manager at the Municipal Health Directorate, Mr Emmanuel Asante-Aboagye, promised that his outfit would help Mr Sackey to go through the various tests required to certify his herbal preparation for eye diseases at the Centre for Plant Medicine Research, Akuapem-Mampong, and the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Tropical Diseases.CollaborationHe, however, advised Mr Sackey to collaborate with the Saltpond Government Hospital by sending all eye patients who reported at his herbal centre to the facility for examination before attending to them, and resend them to the hospital to certifRead morehttp://thebftonline.com/";" 68 ";"triplechoice"

"Hairdressers’ Skin Damaged By Hair Dyes - Health - Nairaland";"Sutured";"The chemical, p-phenylenediamine (PPD), “is a strong contact allergen used in hair dye known to cause allergic contact dermatitis,” Dr. Cezmi Akdis, of the Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research in Davos Platz, and colleagues write in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Both private and occupational exposure to PPD is frequent, but whether it has adverse effects in people with work-related exposure who don’t show allergic symptoms isn’t known, the study team writes.For the current study, researchers tested the effect of PPD exposure on the activity of genes known to be involved in dermatitis and active in skin that has been damaged. They examined gene activity in skin cells after PPD exposure in seven hairdressers without any skin symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction to the chemical, in four people with mild allergic skin reactions to the chemical and in five people with severe allergic skin reactions.The researchers found that hairdressers without obvious allergic reactions to PPD still had gene activity changes in their skin that suggest the skin can be damaged even when the PPD doesn’t cause allergic symptoms like a rash.Hairdressers who apply hair dye to clients several times a day are particularly at risk for PPD exposure. The chemical can also cause allergic reactions in people who regularly dye their own hair, particularly if they use darker colors.Many salons ask customers to do patch tests to see if they will have an allergic reaction to dye before they get their hair colored, but sometimes this can make people more sensitive to the chemical and lead to a rash when their hair is colored a second time.Semi-permanent dye may cause less of a reaction than permanent color. Wearing gloves when dying hair may also reduce the risk of skin damage from PPD.Photographers who develop film and people who get black temporary tattoos and henna tattoos can also be exposed to PPD and have allergic skin reactions as a result, the authors note.In the study, PPD exposure resulted in damage to the epidermis, or outer layer of skin, which plays a crucial role in preventing allergens from entering the body and causing damage, the study team notes.Because they found skin damage both in hairdressers without allergic contact dermatitis and those with mild or acute cases of dermatitis, the results suggest that occupational PPD exposure directly causes skin damage, the study team concludes.source: http://sutured.com/hairdressers-skin-damaged-by-hair-dyes/more: http://sutured.com/";" 94 ";"Sutured"

In fact, for prostatitis, there are numerous classifications. The aforementioned two classifications are only labeled in accordance with the scientific signs and symptoms of prostatitis. In terms of etiology, prostatitis includes Mycoplasma prostatitis. What are its signs?Mycoplasma is a kind of microorganism between bacteria and viruses. It is also the easiest prokaryotic organism that can live independently discovered to date. Mycoplasma hominis has 14 serotypes, which serotype 4 is definitely the major reasons of diseases. Mycoplasma can adhere to the epithelial cells and sperm surface of the genitourinary tract, causing mobile problems. Mycoplasma is actually a typical and principal pathogen of non-gonococcal urethritis. Mycoplasma causes 40% of instances of men non-gonococcal urethritis and a lot of severe epididymitis below 35 years old.When non-gonorrhea urethritis is atypical, or the treatment is not complete, Mycoplasma will spread upward to cause prostatitis and epididymitis according to entering the urinary submucosal urethral gland. Mycoplasma prostatitis is difficult to distinguish from bacterial prostatitis. Therefore, to avoid the missed analysis, Mycoplasma needs to be detected within the diagnosis of microbial prostatitis. In addition, for infertile patients with abnormal semen, the potential of mycoplasma disease in the genital tract should be thought about. Prostate routine evaluation and Mycoplasma recognition ought to be done. The mixed disease of Mycoplasma or Chlamydia often coexists with microorganisms to cause persistent prostatitis. Therefore, for prostatitis caused by blended contamination, the higher amount of bacterial hypersensitive antibiotics combined with over-time medication is effective.Mycoplasma prostatitis should be cultured in prostatic liquid before it can be recognized qualitatively. Even though you have Mycoplasma in your urethra, it will possibly not prove that there is Mycoplasma in the prostate.

In this article, I will be discussing 5 health & nutritional benefits of men’s semen to women.It has been discovered that exposure to semen is very beneficial to women’s health. All thanks to the mood-altering chemicals this body fluid possesses.Before we proceed, let us have a better understanding of what semen is.Semen is a creamy substance, yellowish or greyish in color and it is made up of spermatozoa and seminal plasma fluid.The spermatozoa makes up about 5% of the semen. They look like tadpoles and they are the reproductive cells that are made up of the genetic information used to create a human offspring.The seminal plasma fluid, which is mainly 80% water makes up the rest of the semen. It’s job is to carry the spermatozoa to its destination.To Swallow Sperm: Is It Safe For A Woman To Ingest A Man’s Semen?The answer here is yes. This is because the elements that make up the semen are safe.Semen digests just the same way the human body digests regular food. However, in very rare cases, some people might find that they are allergic to semen when ingested. This condition is called Human Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity (HSP)Keep in mind that you have to be careful when swallowing semen since it may have viruses. These viruses can easily be transmitted if ingested.MouthAction may lead to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Hepatitis B and C, as well as herpes.

A single teaspoon of semen (which is the average volume a man releases per ejaculation) measures up to about 7 calories.As for the taste of semen, well it’s hard to put a finger on that, since it can vary from individual to individual. Some women have said they find the taste salty and bitter, while others have said it’s a bit sugary.Some researchers are of the opinion that a man’s diet can influence the taste of his semen, but there isn’t any concrete evidence to support that claim. At least not yet.There are a good number of foods that can even out the taste of semen and make it a lot more palatable. These include –CeleryParsleyWheatgrassCinnamonNutmegPineapplePapayaOrangesConcerning the taste of semen, well that also varies from person to person, and this could be dependent on factors like the man’s diet, hygiene and health.The most commonly relatable smell of semen is that of bleach. This is because of its composition, which provides the required pH level where the spermatozoa can survive.Semen in most cases is neutral or alkaline, around 7.26 – 8.40 on the pH scale. This ranges from 0 (highly acidic) to 14 (highly alkaline)If the smell of semen is musky, then it could be due to external factors.Your man’s diet can directly affect the smell of his semen. Just as the asparagus affects the smell of urine.So ladies, now that you have a better understanding of what semen is and what it’s made of, let’s proceed to discuss the top 5 health & nutritional benefits of men’s semen to women.Health Benefits of Men’s Semen1. Semen Elevates A Woman’s MoodAccording to a study which analyzed the effects of semen’s “mood altering chemicals”, MouthAction makes women feel happier.Scientists at the University Of New York conducted a study which compared the sex lives of 239 females to their mental health. It was discovered that seminal fluid contained chemicals that elevates a woman’s mood. Strange but true.Survey results showed that women who were directly exposed to the semen showed significantly better mood behavior and lower symptoms of depression.Being in a good mood will help you be more positive and productive, it will also reduce stress levels caused by worry.Give it a try next time you and your man have MouthAction, and you’d be “happy” you did!2. Semen Helps Women Fight InsomniaUsually, after a good round of sex, it is very common for both man and woman to fall asleep. You may think it’s all the “hard work” that put you to sleep, but it’s not.Studies have shown that whether you swallow sperm or it enters your blood stream through your vagina, it will help you fall asleep fast, thanks to the chemical melatonin which is found in semen.This component of a man’s semen is a form of relaxant that helps women be at ease and fall asleep.So, if you’re a lady who keeps struggling with sleep, then I suggest you swallow your man’s semen (as long as he is virus free). Thank me later!3. It Adds Extra Nutrients To Your MealsAccording to the research of Paul Fotie Photenhauer, semen adds a world of nutrients to your meals.As I mentioned earlier, semen is rich in minerals and vitamins, and it has been proven that it adds some “extra value” to your meals. Besides the extra nutrients, semen has a great texture so it blends well with food.Next time you want to make dinner, consider adding some semen to it. It goes very well!4. Semen Is An Anti-depressantThe chemical components of semen helps fight depression. This may seem strange (or new) to you but it’s true!Scientific studies have proven that women who swallow their man’s sperm have lower chances of being depressed. This is not to say that semen is the sole answer to depression, it is just a statement of fact that it’s components have anti-depressant qualities.The nerve growth factor found in semen is a vital hormone that’s missing in the brains of those who have been diagnosed with major depressive disorders. This naturally means that increasing nerve growth factor would make women happier.To add to that, nerve growth factor has anti-inflamatory and anti-oxidant properties.Some of the anti-depressant components of semen include –EndorphinsEstroneProlactinOxytocinThyrotropin releasing hormoneSerotonin5. Stronger And Healthier HairThey say a woman’s hair is her “crown”, well I’m sure you’d like to have your crown strong, shiny and looking great all the time. Believe it or not, men’s semen will do this for your hair.You must have heard of “Keratin Treatment”, where you pay a decent sum of money to put protein in your hair for the benefit of making it stronger. Apparently semen has over 200 different types of protein, these proteins can give your hair the glow and strength you desire.Semen also has a component called spermadine which can be used on human scalps. Spermadine promotes shaft elongation as well as consistent hair growth.Some women tend to intentionally keep semen out of their hair during MouthAction, mainly because of its stickiness, well think again!I recommend semen as a natural hair treatment, consider this the next time you want to have a make-over.Before I leave, I’d like to remind you to consider a few important things first.You may be allergic to semen – As I mentioned earlier in this article, some people (even though very rare) are allergic to semen. Remember when I mentioned Human Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity? That’s the name given to semen allergy. This allergy could lead to itching, hives, chest tightness and difficulty in breathing. Be sure you are not allergic to semen before you swallow!It doesn’t come in huge quantities – A full ejaculation is equivalent to about a teaspoon so you would need a good amount of ejaculation to experience some of the benefits listed above. These results would start to manifest over time the more you swallowMake sure the semen is STD free – This is the most important thing to remember before you ingest your man’s semen. Be absolutely sure that your partner is STD free before you proceed to swallow or ingest his semen. Feel free to go with him to the clinic and do some tests, you’d be more confident this wayConclusionGreat, so those are the top 5 health and nutritional benefits of semen. Consider these the next time you have MouthAction with your man.This may seem all new to you but it is fact, your man’s semen does have some great nutrients packed up inside which can be beneficial to you.How much do you enjoy it and what's your take on it?https://renewhealth.life/swallow-sperm-health-benefits/";" 96 ";"RenewHealth"

"How To Stay Healthy During Harmattan - Health - Nairaland";"mercyokoro24";"Typically, the harmattan season begins to peep in late November and gets into full gear in December. The severity of harmattan depends on where you are in Nigeria. The weather is milder in the southeast and particularly colder and dustier in cities like Plateau, Kano, Taraba, Adamawa, and Bauchi. Apart from the cold and dust, the harmattan season is characterised by thick haze.Below are tips you can follow to ensure that you stay healthy during harmattan.1. Drink a lot of waterParticularly at that time of year, you should increase water intake because it helps your body stay hydrated. Dehydration is more likely during harmattan because of the excessive dryness of the air. Therefore, take a bottle of water with you everywhere you go. This helps facilitate the movement of mucus. Also, hot coffee will help you stay warm during this season.2. Eat a lot of fruits and veggiesNormally, fruits and veggies are good for your body. But particularly during the harmattan season, it helps your body fight infections. It contains vitamins and minerals that can immunize your body flu, cough, and the common cold. Additionally, it also helps your body stay hydrated.3.Take lemon and honey mixed in warm waterThis mixture is highly recommended during the harmattan season. The season comes with a lot of throat issues. So honey and lemon mixed in warm water help your throat stay moisturized. And if there's irritation it can help soothe it. Naturally, honey is a reliever for cold and cough.4.Less exposureThis is a given. Nobody in their right mind will expose themselves in the harmattan season. But there's a difference between covering up and covering up properly. In a bid to look fashionable some people ditch thick clothes in favour of chic designs. You can look nice too in thick clothing, and stay healthy more importantly. Cover your head, either with a head warmer, a hood or a headline.Also, when you're indoors, keep your feet inside thick socks. And when you're going outdoor wear your shoes and gloves. This is particularly for people in Plateau, where the cold attacks the hands and feet. The trick is to generally minimize exposure.5.SkincareThe harmattan brings with it a lot of skin problems like cracked lips and peeling palms. You have to go out of your way to protect your skin. A lot of creams don't have enough moisture in them, so they cannot adequately moisturize your skin. So it is recommended that you add your preferred oil product to your cream. There are many oil products like coconut and olive oil. Make sure every area of your skin gets enough cream and oil to keep it moisturized.For your lips, take time out to regularly moisturize it with lip gloss or any of your preferred lip moisturizer. For people who get skin reactions during the harmattan season, make sure to see your doctor.Source: https://www.ogbeta.ng/2019/12/how-to-stay-healthy-during-harmattan.html";" 98 ";"mercyokoro24"

"5 Body Pains You Should NEVER Ignore - Health - Nairaland";"mrkunlex";"One disturbing fact is that a lot of humans dieyoung. Recent research shows that men are twiceas likely to die than women between the ages of 20and 40.The reason adduced to this is that men tend toignore a lot of stress and pains that women payattention to. Signs and symptoms including chestpains, dizziness, headaches and so on are some ofthe common symptoms men would rather see offthan visit a doctor for.As a result, we decided to put together 5 commonbody pains everyone irrespective of gender shouldpay attention to because they are none negotiable.If you feel any of this pains (especially repeatedly),see a doctor as soon as possible.Sudden Pain In The GroinSharp pains in the groin feels like you’ve beenkicked or punched around your pelvic region and itmay also experience swelling.This kind of pain is called testicular torsion. It mayoccur as a result of congenital defects in which thespermatic chords that hold the testicles in placebecome intertwined.Blood flow to the testicles are cut off and if urgentattention is not given between 24 to 30 hours, thetesticles may be lost. This is treated with surgery.Pain in the groin may also be caused by untreatedbacteria infection of the epididymis which storesspermatozoa. This can be treated with antibiotics.Painful UrinationHaving a rusty blood coloured urine or feelingsevere pain during urination can serve as anindication of bladder cancer which is the thirdmost common type of cancer in men.Research has found smoking to be a big risk factor.Bladder cancer is usually diagnosed by eliminatingsimilar conditions. Tests like urinalysis, followed bya cystoscopy where a scope is inserted to view theinside of the bladder. If there’s a tumour present, itcan be removed through surgery, chemotherapy orradiation.Sharp Abdominal PainAbdominal pains that come with a sharp, bitingfeeling is a cause for concern because yourabdominal area contains a lot of organs and thepain could be as a result of an inflamed pancreas,appendix or gallbladder.The cause for these three conditions are usually ablocked organ which results in infection of theorgans around the area. The best bet is to runlaboratory tests. If you have a high white bloodcells count, you may be suffering fromappendicitis. If the pain is in your upper abdomen,then it’s probably an inflamed gallbladder.More so, if you feel the pain beneath yourbreastbone, and laboratory blood tests showelevated liver enzymes, then you may be sufferingfrom pancreatitis. See a doctor to prescribe theappropriate laboratory tests.Throbbing Chest PainIf you have a heavy ache which comes and leavessuddenly could be as a result of simple indigestionor a more serious impending heart attack.Blood clots could have formed in narrow sectionsof your coronary artery and this stops the flow ofblood to a part of your heart. It is important to seea doctor as soon as possible as over half of alldeaths resulting from heart attacks occur withinthe first 5 hours of the first symptoms.The doctor requests tests relating to Biomarkers ofdamaged tissues in the heart. It is mostly treatedwith a coronary heart bypa$$ graft or angioplasty(a procedure used to widen obstructed veins orarteries).Serious Pain In The Lower BackSufferers of this pain have described it as anagonising pain which doesn’t get relieved evenafter they use painkillers or rest their bodies. Suchpain is not related to exercise and may be a sign ofa brain or abdominal aneurysm.Of particular note is the abdominal aneurysmwhich signifies a weakening of the aorta lyingabove the kidneys. If it gets burst, a person may diewithin 30 minutes. A less severe possibility iskidney stones that also comes with its ownexcruciating pain in sufferers.The abdominal aneurysm can be treated withblood-pressure pressure medications to controlblood flow.Read More";" 124 ";"mrkunlex"

Yes I've been living a very promiscuous lifestyle and its more reason for me to be scared of doing a test. Although I've done it before in 2014 and it was negative but since then, there have been a lot of sexcapades.

""To those with the virus already I'd like to ask: ""Did you experience something like that before you were confirmed as positive? ""Ps: I treated malaria last month by the way.

"Steps To Become A Registered Nurse In Nigeria - Health - Nairaland";"generalbush";"Do you aspire to become a Registered nurse in Nigeria? This post will clearly explain to you how to achieve that. Before you go ahead to purchase any nursing form, be sure to go through this post and get the best insight on how to become a nurse in Nigeria. Nursing was included as one of the best science courses in NigeriaDo you know that there are three (3) ways to become a registered midwife or nurse in Nigeria? They are;The 3-year basic Midwifery Training ProgramThe 3 year basic General Nursing Program andThe 5-year BSc Nursing Degree ProgramThe advantage is that these three routes have the same entry requirement of five credits in five subjects which are; English, Maths, Biology, Physics, and Chemistry in not more than 2 sittings. To enter major universities to study nursing, you must have credits in the above courses listed above. The difference is the Jamb requirements for the BNSc programme. This means that you have the choice to either basic nursing/midwife program, or you sit for Jamb for the BNSc program.The 5-year Generic BNSc Nursing ProgramThis program is designed to make you a polyvalent nursing practitioner. At the end of your program, you graduate with the General Nursing program qualification, the Midwifery program qualification, and a Bachelor’s degree in Nursing (BNSc). Depending on your institution, you can equally graduate with an extra qualification in public health nursing. With these qualifications, you can easily move on to earn your masters in Nursing before a PhD in Nursing. This is one of the routes to become a registered nurse in Nigeria.The 3 year Basic Midwifery Training ProgramThe obvious drawback to this route is the fact that after qualifying as a registered midwife in this way, most recruiting organizations still request a double qualified practitioner. This means that you still have to go back for another 18 months post basic general nursing course. Another fact to note before using this route to become a registered nurse in Nigeria is that most Nigerian universities don’t accept RN for direct entry purposes.The 3 year Basic General Nursing ProgramFor the basic general nursing program, an average of N250, 000 is needed for the admission fee. You should also know that the 3-year duration isn’t inclusive of the 6 months that you would spend in PTS.  The 3 years can be extended to 4, 5 years in different guises such as demotion, pregnancy, suspension by SON principals, accreditation issues, failure in your exams, and other endless reasons.Even after writing the NMCN exams, you would be required to spend some extra months working for free in hospital wards pending when the council releases your final qualifying result.Another important fact to note is that the general nursing and basic midwifery routes are both hospital-based programs with professional licensure and it was only in October of 2007 that an expert assessors committee accorded the qualifications obtained therein the same as HND attracting a grade level08 (step 1) for employment purposes only and NOT for academic purposes. A major advantage though, of obtaining an RN qualification either via route 1,2 or 3 to become a registered nurse in Nigeria is that it qualifies you to practice as a nurse abroad. RN qualification is also a valid requirement for further studies in the Nigerian university system for direct entry (DE) into degree programs in philosophy, psychology, social works etc The major drawback for those who aspire to become a registered nurse in Nigeria at the moment is embroiled in a bitter fight for the soul of Nursing professionalism. Earning a degree in these previously and erroneously tagged “degrees allied to Nursing” according to our statutory regulatory body NMCN does not qualify one to progress to the directorate Nursing cadre. This stance by the NMCN reinforced the position of the National Council on the establishment (NCE) at its 37th Meeting in Akure where it stated that “Possession of a first degree in NURSING, not allied courses is a sine qua non of running the nursing officers cadre.  LUTH management also reaffirmed this when it refused accepting Masters degrees in these “allied course” obtained by lecturers in its school of Midwifery insisting that professional progression must be dependent on the acquisition of masters degree in core Nursing courses for holders of BNSc qualification, not masters in an allied course. Thus the route may provide an avenue for further degrees in other professional domains but these degrees outside of Nursing may count for nothing professionally.In the long run, the abysmal remuneration of being a single qualified (RN) nurse would force you to seek further post basic qualification which costs an average of another N250,000 to N300,000 in admission costs. I forgot to add that most post basic programs would insist that you should have practised for at least 2 years before applying; a two-year experience you would gain trolling from one private hospital to another where you would be overworked and underpaid.Remember, this post basic qualification to become a registered nurse in Nigeria is a prerequisite if you would want to be employed on GL 08 step 4 instead of step 1 if you had only an RN. What this means is that you may never get to the peak as your professional growth terminates abruptly at grade level 14 and you can only go beyond this on lateral conversion to the officer’s cadre following acquisition of a Nursing degree By this time, six years or more would have rolled by. You probably have gotten married with kids and wishing you went with route 3 (BNSc Nursing). Albeit late, you decide to start the 4-year university route. If financially buoyant, you probably enrol in a neighbouring country like Benin Republic, Ghana, niger for a BNSc program or you spend another two years battling to get a DE admission to a Nigerian university. Adult education at this time puts your marriage under strain, your life is put at risk as you make multiple treacherous travels to the university, the emotional and psychological torture cannot be quantified not to talk of the financial burden of university admission. The entire rigmarole is just time wasting, psychologically demeaning and heart-wrenching.  Globally, the system of education in nursing is changing. I sincerely hope that this article on NursingworldNigeria.com enlightens you to make an informed decision on which route suits you best. I wish you best of luck.

"Man Has 3lbs Of ‘rotting’ Muscle Removed After Injecting Himself With OIL (pics) - Health - Nairaland";"dre11";"A former soldier who earned the nickname ‘Popeye’ after injecting his arms with jelly to create bulging biceps has had to undergo surgery to save his life.Kirill Tereshin, 23, was warned he could die or need to have both his arms amputated because of the articifial biceps he had created.Surgeons at First Moscow State Medical University in the Russian capital said they had removed 3lb of dead muscle and three litres of petroleum jelly that had formed into a solid lump.And lead surgeon Dmitry Melnikov said his team was only a quarter of the way through the huge operation. It will take at least three more surgeries for all of the Vaseline-like jelly to be removed from Kirill’s arms, Dr Melnikov said.The bodybuilder – who found global fame for his fake bulging biceps – was persuaded to undergo urgent treatment by Alana Mamaeva, 32, a leading campaigner for victims of botched plastic surgery. She released a video showing Kirill after his first operation frantically asking the surgeon: ‘How many muscles have I lost?’The surgeon said: ‘The problem is that this is the petroleum jelly. You injected this so thoroughly, that it spread in the muscle and killed it.‘It was dead anyway.’[img]https://cdn.dailytrust.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Man-has-3lbs-of-‘rotting’-muscle-removed-after-injecting-himself-with-OIL-600x207.jpg[/img]Man has 3lbs of ‘rotting’ muscle removed after injecting himself with OILHe added: ‘We have done 25% of the repairs.’Kirill has been told he will have arm movement but the muscles in his arms will be diminished. Alana, who helped raise funds for his surgery, said: ‘We are going to try and help this young man.’Former army conscript Kirill told her before the operation: ‘I am ready, I am even not afraid.’ Dr Melnikov told his patient: ‘Petroleum jelly saturates the muscles, under skin tissues and the skin itself.‘All that has to be removed, but we need to keep the vein, nerves and other functions of the limb.’He added: ‘Petroleum jelly is not designed for injection, only external application. Kirill injected about three litres into each arm.‘It saturated the muscle tissues, blocked blood flow and as a result the tissue dies and gets replaced with a scar which is as tough as a tree.’ He said the implants were causing him ‘high fever, strong pain, and weakness’. Kirill was ‘lucky’ that the damage had remained only in his limbs and not spread to the rest of his body, the surgeon said.[img]https://cdn.dailytrust.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Man-has-3lbs-of-‘rotting’-muscle-removed-after-injecting-himself-with-OIL-600x207.jpg[/img]Dr Melnikov added: ‘Petroleum jelly affects the whole body, kidneys in particular.‘I think Kirill did not fully realise the consequences of what he had been doing.’In Russia, plastic surgery involving injecting petroleum jelly under the surface of the skin has been on the rise, especially with people seeking ‘fillers’. The surgeon said he had seen patients previously who had the dangerous substance injected into their breasts, buttocks and faces.https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/man-has-3lbs-of-rotting-muscle-removed-after-injecting-himself-with-oil.htmlLalasticlala";" 298 ";"dre11"

"Improving Memory - Health - Nairaland";"trinjen";"“Right now,” said Steven Wright, “I’m having amnesia and deja vu at the same time. I think I’ve forgotten this before.” And while it’s true that youngsters do forget names, math facts, and when Dad said to be home, many folks 50 and older notice that their recall (what year did we go to California?) isn’t what it used to be.When you have such a senior moment, it’s just a stutter in what’s called episodic memory, and rarely is it long-lasting. But if you’re concerned about your recall, talk to your doc about stress, sleep problems, depression, thyroid disease, diabetes, vitamin B-12 deficiency, excess alcohol use, infections, and your medications. They’re all possible memory-busters. And try our unforgettable, brain-boosting tips!Walk fast for at least 30 minutes daily, heading for 10,000 steps a day. Any exercise, but especially aerobics that make you sweat, is the very best memory enhancer.Cut body-wide inflammation with omega-3 DHA from salmon or ocean trout; and take 900 mg of DHA from algal oil daily. Add in more omega-3s: walnuts, canola, and extra-virgin olive oil.Try the spice turmeric to reduce triglyceride levels, increase fat burning, and keep blood sugar steady. Dr. Mike carries packets of yellow mustard, full of turmeric, to add to snacks and meals.Take two baby aspirins daily (if your doc approves) with a half-glass of water before and after.Get romantic. The neurotransmitter dopamine helps control information flow and memory. Levels decrease with age, but zoom up with sexual activity.If you’ve hit mid-life, you’ve probably noticed signs of aging — wrinkles, thinning hair, and maybe a few extra pounds around your hips or belly.And while that creeping middle-aged weight gain may not be desirable . . .There’s one area of your body you should keep as plump and fat as possible — and that’s your brain. You see, your brain shrinks by about 5% per decade after you hit age 40. Maybe that doesn’t sound like much to you, but listen . . Your brain contains about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons.Each piece of your brain the size of a speck of sand contains 100,000 neurons all trying to talk to each other through 1 billion connecting points called synapses.This allows over 100,000 chemical reactions to occur in your brain every second. Crucial chemicals called neurotransmitters move across connection points and release their contents into gaps between these synapses.And all these connections going on inside your brain are what allow you to create and retain memories, form ideas and thoughts, experience emotions, and even express your unique personality.Why You Want a Fat BrainYour brain only weighs about 3 pounds. Yet about 60% of your brain is fat. This makes your brain the fattest organ you have. And this fat is essential for your brain to function. For one thing, your brain requires fat for energy. Although your brain makes up only about 2% of your body weight, it uses a whopping 20% of the energy your body produces just to function normally.Fat is necessary to create brain cell membranes and produce neurotransmitters. Plus, it serves as the raw material to make hormones.And fat makes up about 60% to 80% of the myelin sheath, a protective covering around nerve axons. These axons represent the primary transmission lines of your nervous system.As you can see, the fat in your brain serves many vital functions.Shrinkage Matters to Your Memory — Especially if You’re a WomanTwo areas of your brain especially prone to age-related shrinkage are the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. These are important parts of the brain when it comes to memory, learning, and other complex mental activities.With aging, neurons themselves shrink in number and volume. The connections between nerve cells deteriorate and become less extensive. The level of neurotransmitters declines.And a shrinking brain is only one of the changes your brain faces as the years pass. With aging, the brain undergoes a gradual reduction in blood flow. Aging speeds up an imbalanced process of inflammation in the brain (as well as the entire body). Free radicals in the brain and body accumulate at a faster rate with age. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can damage neurons and other cells throughout the body.Scientists have found that women suffer more age-related shrinkage in areas of the brain related to memory than men do. And while men are not exempt from those frustrating “senior moments,” their brain shrinkage tends to cause more changes in areas related to thinking and feeling.So what does all this mean?Well, by the time you hit mid-life, when it comes to brain health, you’re no longer on the offense.After 40, You Need to Play aYou may have noticed that you tend to forget where you put things — like your car keys. Or your phone. Or your glasses, even when they’re sitting on top of your head. Or you might forget appointments or names of people you’ve just met.You might have more difficulty concentrating or focusing on tasks than you used to. Or perhaps you have a foggy brain feeling that keeps you from thinking clearly. You see, aging is the single greatest risk factor for developing memory concerns.And over 60% of people middle-aged and older suffer some degree of memory impairment. In fact, according to the National Institute on Aging, memory problems are one of the first warning signs of cognitive loss, which involves mental slowing and declining intellect.Fortunately, while you can’t stop the inevitable march of time . . .You can take some simple steps to combat brain shrinkage and other signs of aging that could impact your memory — and your quality of life.Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Mike Roizen, Newsmax Healthhttp://www.mediaissuesng.com/health/5-ways-to-enhance-your-memory/https://heliossupplements.com/pages/krill-oil-vs-fish-oil";" 54 ";"trinjen"

Another problem is that the neutralizing antibodies require rare changes in their genetic make-up that are infrequently made during a crucial B-cell diversification process. In the current study, the researchers traced those relevant mutations. Then they engineered an HIV protein, targeting a site called the V3 glycan region of the virus envelope, that preferentially bound to antibodies that have the unlikely but necessary mutations...http://haleplushearty.org/2019/12/05/immune-system-can-be-coaxed-into-selecting-key-antibodies-to-fight-hiv/haleplushearty.org";" 83 ";"Haleplushearty"

"Why Are Prayers Only For “barren Women” But Not “impotent Men”? Dr Olufunmilayo - Health - Nairaland";"udomoh";"“Why does infertility in African culture stigmatize and blame women?” Why do churches offer special prayers for “barren women” but never “impotent men”? – Dr Olufunmilayo asks a rhetorical question.Read below…..Why is it that in churches, there are special prayers for “barren women”, but never “impotent men”?Why do Pastors call people who are “seeking God for children” and only women come out, but never men?Society and culture has made childlessness a woman’s problem. But it is not.Why do you see a couple struggling to have children and you only wonder if the wife’s womb is intact, but not the man’s penis or testicles?Why do our movies suggest a childless couple have the challenge because the woman had many abortions but not because the man had many STDs.However you know what the facts of the matter is? Infertility is not a woman’s problem. It is a couple problem. In other words, the medical fact is infertility is never solely due to the woman, but can be due to problems from both the man and the woman. Many of you don’t know.If as a man,You take excessive alcohol,You smoke cigarettes, shisha etc,You wear very tight underwear,You have repeated STDs untreated,You have low sperm count,You have problems with good erection,ALL of these, can make you infertile, Or difficult to ever father a child.If as a woman,You have irregular periods,You are overweight,You smoke cigarettes, shisha etc,You have repeated STDs untreated,You produce milk when not pregnant,You insert nonsense into your vagina to “tighten”, “flush” and “upgrade” it,ALL these can make you infertile.These are the things we should be educating one another about.Not trying to pin all problems of infertility on women.That’s counterproductive and unintelligent.And that’s why when a couple goes to see a doctor, about infertility, the doctor will do tests for both of them.This is why we must be different in our generation and not perpetuate the shameful stereotype that all infertility in marriages must surely be because of the woman.Let me clarify, I’m not saying it can never be because if the woman.I’m saying it can also be because of the man.Of course one can reply and say: “But why do men get side chicks pregnant after their wives fail to give them children”?So many reasons: Irregular sex, The wife not ovulating, The wife having problems, Or just sheer being unlucky.Have you tried flipping the coin?Let me help.Think of this:If a couple were having challenges having a child, do you know if the woman went out to have unprotected sex, like some men do, she can also get pregnant?But this rarely happens. Because married women don’t.That doesn’t mean those married women are infertile.Anyway, if you are married or looking for children, Have unprotected sex 4 times a week.Cut down alcohol- not more than one small glass a week. Stop smoking completely- shisha, cigarettes etc Stay off contraceptives.Don’t swallow semen- that’s not where it should goIf you are over 30 years, try those ideas for six months, If you are under 30, try it for one year, If after this duration, you still find difficulties getting pregnant, DO NOT WAIT any longer.Go and see a doctor ASAP. So that if there is need for medical help, it can commence.I hope this short post has educated you a little about infertility causes and what you can do, But beyond that, I hope this has opened your eyes to the unfortunate unfair stigmatisation of married women as being “barren”, when the fault may never be theirs.In conclusion,  the views of infertility in African culture is not fair to women and needs to been re-oriented.Thanks for reading.Responses/Reactions7thCakes@IpheormaReplying to@DrOlufunmilayoit’s because of all the times in the bible that couples dealt with childlessness the cure usually came from God opening the womb of the woman. Hannah, Sarah, Rebecca had husbands who had children from other women. I maybe wrong but things like this make it easy toBelieve the woman has a problem. Plus every time God was angry at a person he shuts the womb of the women and cattle nothing about the sperm e.g Abimelech.https://nimedhealth.com.ng/2019/08/15/infertility-in-african-culture/?amp";" 13591 ";"udomoh"

"All You Need To Know About Asthma - Health - Nairaland";"opeyemix";"http://www.sidexblog.com/2017/07/all-you-need-to-know-about-asthma.htmlLet's take a look at what causes AsthmaAsthma is caused by inflamed airways, which makes them sensitive to inhaled particles, generating more inflammation. During a flare up, asthma sufferers cough, wheeze and generally have trouble filling their lungs. In the U.S., as many as 25 million people have asthma.While there is no conventional cure for asthma, there are a variety of treatments, most notably steroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs. These medications are often necessary, but I’d like to explore more holistic approaches to controlling inflammation and decreasing the airways’ sensitivity to inhaled particles. During the winter season in particular, people with asthma often need extra support, since indoor air quality and reduced immune function can worsen symptoms.Identify allergiesQuite often, lung inflammation is just one manifestation of a larger allergic response. This could be a reaction to something in the air, such as dust mites or household chemicals, or a food allergy. One study of inner city youth found that 24 percent of all asthmatic kids had at least one food allergy or sensitivity. The prevalence of food allergies is increasing, so we can expect asthma to keep pace.The first step should be to identify any allergies. Reducing or eliminating exposure to allergenic foods, the most common being dairy, soy, gluten and eggs, as well as other common allergens, can reduce symptoms. If allergens are airborne, an air purification system can also help. Allergies and sensitivities can be detected through a variety of tests ordered by an allergist, or by selectively eliminating specific foods and observing any improvements and changes.BacteriaA recent study found a link between chronic bacterial infections and asthma. Researchers in Australia examined patients with asthma or rhinosinusitis and found bacterial infections in 83 percent of study participants. Many of these patients had Staphylococcus aureus, the close relative antibiotic-resistant MRSA, as well as other bacteria that have shown drug resistance.These findings underscore the importance of strong immunity when dealing with asthma. It’s the best way to address these chronic infections and the inflammatory conditions they may fuel.SupplementsThere are many botanicals that can help us reduce airway inflammation and thus control asthma symptoms. Medicinal mushrooms are well known for their ability to balance immunity, modulate inflammation and provide numerous other benefits. One variety, Cordyceps sinensis, has been shown to reduce airway inflammation and hypersensitivity in animals.Another issue can be vitamin deficiency, particularly vitamin D. One study found that reduced vitamin D levels were closely linked to reduced lung function. Although this research was mainly focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it has applications in asthma as well. In addition, I recommend vitamins A, C and E, which also offer lung protection.Ginger can be useful to treat asthma. One study found that ginger can open up airways by relaxing smooth muscle. I also recommend the herb Lobelia, which supports breathing and the cough reflex. Lobelia also synergizes with ginger to support lung function.Honokiol, which is extracted from Magnolia bark, is known for its powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capabilities. Some research has indicated it can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress following lung injury.Galectin-3 is an inflammatory protein associated with cancer, heart disease and other conditions related to inflammation and fibrosis. As such, research shows galectin-3 to be a potential therapeutic target in asthma treatment. There is a unique natural compound to address galectin-3 elevation: Modified citrus pectin (MCP). Derived from orange peels, MCP is a form of citrus pectin that has been modified for absorption into the circulation and increased bioactivity. MCP binds to excess galectin-3 to block its pro-cancer, pro-inflammatory effects. MCP is also known for its ability safely remove heavy metals and support immunity.A Tibetan herbal formula is also recomended for its ability to reduce inflammation and provide anti-oxidant support. This ancient blend of powerful herbs also supports immunity and controls inflammation, making it an excellent supplement for asthma sufferers. A healthy dietMany people have touted the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, olive oil, lean protein, legumes and whole grains. This diet is well known for its anti-inflammatory effects, and people who adopt this diet often lower their risks for heart disease and cancer.This approach seems to work for asthma as well. A study conducted in New Zealand found that asthma patients who switched to a Mediterranean diet did better than those who stayed with their existing food plan.Medical practice in this country often treats asthma in isolation: These are the symptoms and the drugs that will address those symptoms. But we can’t really treat the condition until we understand its underlying causes. Because asthma has such an impact on quality of life, reducing the frequency and intensity of flare-ups by making simple diet and lifestyle changes can be life-changing. Underlying contributing factors may vary between patients, but if we look at chronic infections, allergens and nutrition, we can find the right combination of food and supplements to mitigate symptoms. Asthma isn’t an easy condition to treat, but with a little extra effort we can breathe easier and improve other areas of health as well.http://www.sidexblog.com/2017/07/all-you-need-to-know-about-asthma.html";" 448 ";"opeyemix"

"Early Signs Of HIV Infection - Health - Nairaland";"jannydear";"Human immunodeficiency Virus, HIV is a virus that attacks and weakens the body’s immune system. The HIV virus destroys cells in the body that helps keep infections at bay.The early signs of HIV varies from one individual to another. However, there are some general HIV symptoms common to both men and women. Sexually active adults are advised to get tested for HIV, particularly after engaging in unprotected sex.Apart from sexual contact, HIV can be transmitted through sharing of sharp objects including needles, blades, and others.A person who has been exposed to HIV virus may experience flu-like symptoms including fever, fatigue, headache, at the early stage. This can make it tough to detect since other health conditions equally mimic these symptoms. The most assured way of knowing your HIV status is by getting HIV test with or without flu-like symptoms.READ ALSO: Early Signs of HIV in MenThe early signs of HIV generally appears within the first 1-2 months of infection. Most persons will experience these flu-like symptoms. A person’s viral load at this point is high and can easily spread the virus by engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse. This is why it is vital to get tested for HIV on regular basis as it increases your chances of surviving the deadly infection.In this article, we discuss the common early signs and symptoms of HIV infection to watch out for. We also listed the HIV infection common to men and women. A knowledge of these signs would help to detect the disease at its initial stage of infection.FeverFever is one of the early signs of HIV. It is often accompanied by other mild symptoms like sore throat, fatigue, and swollen lymph glands. The virus at this point has gained access into the blood stream and has started duplicating itself in large numbers. Fever and other flu-like symptoms is your body’s natural response to an infection. So, when the HIV virus begins to replicate itself rapidly, it triggers an inflammation in your immune system.Headache and FatigueAn inflamed immune system triggered by the HIV virus can cause headache, lethargy and exhaustion. At times it can make you feel breathless while walking. Weakness can also occur at the later stages of HIV infection.READ ALSO: Surprising Things Most People Don’t Know About HIV And AIDSNausea and vomiting and diarrheaEarly signs of HIV infection also includes digestive problems like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, these intestinal issues can also be experienced in the later stages of HIV infection, which is typically as the consequence of an opportunistic infection. Drink lots of water and fluid to stay hydrated. One major sign to know your diarrhea is triggered by an HIV infection is if it refuses to respond to the normal treatment.Swollen lymph nodes, achy muscles and joint painSwollen lymph nodes, joint pains, and achy muscles are also early signs of HIV infection. Your immune system also comprises of lymph nodes, which helps protect your blood by eliminating bacteria and viruses. An infection can cause your lymph nodes to become swollen. Lymph nodes can be found in your neck, armpit, and groin. You can feel pains in these parts of your body when there’s an infection.Sore throat and dry coughSore throat, accompanied by dry cough, are also early signs of HIV infection. A persistent dry cough that lasts months without appearing to resolve even with intake of antibiotics and inhalers may point to HIV infection.Night sweatsMost people with HIV infection will experience night sweats at the early stages of the infection even in freezing weather conditions. Night sweats can also be experienced during the late stages of the infection.Skin rashSkin rashes is also one of the signs of HIV which can occur at the early or late stages of HIV. HIV rash can look like itchy boils with pink breakouts.InfectionsAs the HIV infection destroys the body’s immune system, it renders it incapable of eliminating opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiasis (vaginal, oral), and yeast infectionsFor men and women with HIV, infections may occur at different parts of the body including brain, lungs, skin, digestive tract, skin, and eyes.Early Signs of HIV Infection in MenAccording to statistics, more men in the United States are living with HIV compared to women. People with HIV can live long healthy lives without spreading the virus to others using antiretroviral medication.The early signs of HIV infection in men are mostly mistaken for flu or other mild condition. People may easily underestimate them or mistake them for minor health conditions.Some few days or weeks after a male has been exposed to HIV virus, he may experience flu-like signs including:HeadachesTiredness or lethargyFeverSore throatSkin rashAs the infection progresses but still at the early stage, men may experience weight loss and dementia.As the viral load increases, some other signs of HIV begin to show up. Some less common early symptoms of HIV may include:Sore musclesMouth ulcersJoint painSwollen lymph nodesGenital ulcerNight sweatNausea or vomitingThese early signs of HIV infection in men can be underrated as mistaken for a milder condition. Delaying to get tested or see a doctor can increase the viral load, thereby worsening the symptoms of HIV as the infection progresses. This may be one reason why the HIV infection is more common in men than women.HIV Test for MenSexually active males are expected to get tested for HIV at least 3-4 times in a year. According to CDC recommendation, everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV.What are the First Signs of HIV in Female?There are some early signs of HIV infection that is common to both males and females. These common symptoms includes:Flu-like symptoms like fever, headache, lethargySkin rashes and soresSwollen lymph nodesNight sweatsOther early signs of HIV that is only experienced by women include:Menstrual changesMenstrual changes is among some early signs of HIV in females. HIV infection can cause a woman’s period to be heavier or lighter than it used to be. In some cases, women with HIV infection may not even see their period, and if they do, they will experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that are severe.Pelvic Inflammatory disease (PID)Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tube. Females with PID who also test positive to HIV may experience recurrent PID symptoms that is difficult to treat.Advanced Signs of HIV/AIDSAs HIV infection advances, symptoms begin to deteriorate, particularly when an infected person is not on antiretroviral medication. Late signs of HIV infection include:muscle achesshortness of breathdiarrheaweight losssevere headachejoint painnausea and/or vomitingchronic coughdifficulty swallowingIn advanced stages, symptoms of HIV may include:mental confusionshort-term memory losscomaAcquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), is the last stage of HIV infection. At this stage, the CD4 of an infected person drops below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. The body’s immune system is badly conceded, and is virtually unable to fight off infections.A person may be exposed to high risks of developing certain cancers, including cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma.Bottom lineThere is no cure for HIV. It is essential to spot HIV infection at its early stages so as to increase your chances of surviving the disease. This is why it is vital for everyone to get tested for HIV. The HIV test isn’t only for those who are sexually active, though these class of people are mostly at high risk. Even having sexual intercourse for the very first time in your life with an infected person automatically exposes you to the virus. Early detection of HIV saves life.The intake of antiretroviral medications and attaining viral suppression will intensely cut down a person’s risk of developing opportunistic infections and help increase chances of living long, healthy lives.Source: https://healthdiary365.com/early-signs-of-hiv-infection/";" 208 ";"jannydear"

"Doctor's Best High Potency Serrapeptase 120,000 Spu 90 Veggie Caps For Sale - Health - Nairaland";"TaniaJay";"Price: #14,000Location: LagosContact me via WhatsApp using the link in signature. ThanksFor more than 25 years, Serrapeptase has been used by millions of people concerned about their health. Originally, Serrapeptase was exclusively used in Asia and Europe due to its anti-inflammatory activity, but when the benefits of this miracle enzyme spread, the US and many other countries began to use it for its wide range of benefits. For many the question still remains, what exactly is Serrapeptase and what are the benefits for which it has gained such enormous popularity?Serrapeptase is a proteolytic enzyme that is also known as serrapeptidase, serratiopeptidase, serratia peptidase, nicolase, the super enzyme, and the miracle enzyme. This enzyme is produced by non-pathogenic bacteria called Serratia sp. E-15 which is found in the intestines of silkworms. It was discovered that serrapeptase dissolves the cocoon walls that silkworms live in when they begin to transform into moths. Due to this discovery, it is theorized that this enzyme is capable of dissolving dead tissue without causing harmful side effects to an organism’s healthy cells.Health Benefits of Serrapeptase1. AtherosclerosisDr. Nieper found that serrapeptase promoted normal blood clotting and reduced the appearance of varicose veins. Other studies found that serrapeptase effectively removes atherosclerotic plaque without hurting any of the healthy cells along the arterial wall.2. Soothes RednessMultiple studies confirm serrapeptase soothes redness and swelling. It promotes a calm, harmonious environment in the body at a cellular level.3. Helps with Traumatic InjuriesSerrapeptase is widely used in Europe as a supplement for traumatic injury (such as sprains and torn ligaments), as well as the swelling associated with post-surgical patients.4. Pain, Edema, and SwellingSerrapeptase has been approved as a standard remedy in many European countries for swelling. A double-blind German study on the enzyme found that it could reduce swelling by up to 50% in post-operative patients. Patients taking serrapeptase experienced less pain than the control groups and, by the 10th day of the study, all patients taking the serrapeptase were completely pain-free.5. Helps with Cystic Breast DiseaseIn a double-blind study, serrapeptase was found to reduce breast pain, breast swelling, and induration in 85.7% of the patients taking the supplement. This is related to the fact that the enzyme possesses fibrinolytic, proteolytic and anti-edemic properties.6. Helps Infections in the Ear, Nose, and ThroatIn one double-blind study, patients with acute or chronic ear, nose or throat diseases found significant symptom regression with serrapeptase. The enzyme can reduce the viscosity of mucous, thus facilitating drainage.7. Helps with Carpal Tunnel SyndromeRecent studies confirm the use of this enzyme for the reduction of symptoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.8. Other Potential BenefitsSerrapeptase is used for a vast array of applications for human health and disease prevention. This includes therapeutic use for nerve damage, Multiple Sclerosis, chronic ear infections, hay fever, lung congestion, swollen glands, laryngitis, rhinitis, chronic pain, arthritis, back and neck pain, diabetes, ulcers, osteoporosis, prostate problems, rheumatoid arthritis, sports injuries (both prevention and recovery), post-operative scars and lesions, varicose veins, arterial diseases, angina, blood clots, anti-aging, restoration of healthy fibrin metabolism and reduction in C-Reactive Protein.";" 871 ";"TaniaJay"

"How Women Can Overcome Midlife Crisis - Health - Nairaland";"NseKaren";"Midlife needn't be a ""crisis"" at all; it could be a transition or an opportunity for significant, positive change. Unfortunately, midlife crisis is crisis brought about by psychological events that highlight a person’s growing age, inevitable mortality and possibly shortcomings of accomplishments in life. Let’s be kinder to ourselves!From 40 years old and above, your body changes, your mind changes, your energy changes, we become perimenopausal and can’t do everything we once thought we could. A lot of us are unprepared for this life stage.Midlife leads to feelings and behaviors that reflect a desire to recapture lost youth, or to realize neglected dreams and ambitions. It’s a time where a woman finally has the guts to take back her life! At this time there is no deluding yourself that you have unlimited number of years left—so, it is a sort of “Now-or-Never” moment in your life.Mid-life crisis could be caused by aging itself, or aging in combination with changes, problems, or regrets over:• Work, vocation (religious inclusive) or career (or lack thereof)• Spousal relationships (or lack thereof)• Maturation of children (or lack of children)• Aging parents, its attending health issues and care giving or death of • Physical changes associated with agingMidlife crisis manifest in different ways; its signs include but not limited to:1. Apathy, indifference, feelings of depression, remorse, and anxiety2. Compare self to your mates and jealous of other people’s achievements3. Asking yourself probing questions such as if you are in the right profession, career line or vocation4. Rash decision making or drastic changes to current lifestyle5.

"Fish Stuck In Boy’s Nose, Removed Alive (pics) - Health - Nairaland";"ijustdey";"In a shocking incident, a fish has been removed alive from the nostril of a boy after a 3-hour-long surgery by doctors. Interestingly, the fish was alive until it was removed. The fish entered when the boy was taking his bath in a farm well. The strange incident took place in the Pudukkottai district in Tamil Nadu., India.According to sources, S Arul Kumar (12) of Mannavelampatti near Annavasal in Pudukkottai went for a bath along with his friends in a farm well near his house last Tuesday evening. Arul then sensed that something had entered his nose, and soon developed severe pain.He was then rushed to the Annavasal Gemeral Hospital around 10 pm and the duty doctor, Kathiravan, who checked the boy’s nostrils, confirmed a fish being stuck inside Arul’s nose.After a three-hour-long ‘operation’ the doctor removed a live ‘tilapia’ fish from the boy’s nose, but it died soon after. The doctor observed that the trapped fish could have even caused a threat to Arul’s life.The boy after an hour’s medical observation was sent back home.https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/fish-stuck-in-boys-nose-removed-alive.htmlLalasticlala";" 277 ";"ijustdey"

"Why You Should Use RAW HONEY - Health - Nairaland";"PureBeeHoney";"What is raw honey?It’s a pure, unfiltered and unpasteurized sweetener made by bees from the nectar of flowers. Most of the honey consumed today is processed honey that’s been heated and filtered since it was gathered from the hive. Unlike processed honey, raw honey does not get robbed of its incredible nutritional value and health powers. It can help with everything from low energy to sleep problems to seasonal allergies. Switching to raw honey may even help weight-loss efforts when compared to diets containing sugar or high fructose corn syrup. I’m excited to tell you more about one of my all-time favorite natural sweeteners today.8 Health Benefits of Raw Honey1. Healthy Weight ManagementResearch studies have linked honey consumption with weight loss. A San Diego State University study found that replacing sugar with honey can actually help prevent packing on extra pounds and also lower blood sugar. The results also suggest that in comparison to sugar, honey may lower serum triglycerides. Another study from the University of Wyoming found that raw honey can activate hormones that suppress the appetite. In the double-blind randomly assigned study, appetite hormones and glycemic responses were measured in 14 healthy non-obese women after consuming a breakfast containing either honey or sugar. Overall, researchers concluded that honey consumption offers potential obesity protective effects. 2. Counters Pollen AllergiesRaw honey contains bee pollen, which is known to ward off infections, provide natural allergy relief and boost overall immunity. Honey’s ability to prevent allergies is based on a concept called immunotherapy. How so? The bees in your neighborhood go from flower to flower collecting pollen that causes you to suffer, but when a you consume local raw honey, you also consume that same offending local pollen. After some time, an allergy sufferer may become less sensitive to this pollen that previously caused problems and experience less seasonal allergy symptoms. Many seasonal allergy sufferers have found local, raw honey to be helpful because it desensitizes them to the fauna triggering their allergic reaction.A 2013 study found that eating honey at a high dose (one gram per kilogram of body weight of honey daily) can improve allergy symptoms over a period of eight weeks. Researchers absorbed that the honey consumption improved overall and individual symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is an allergic response that causes itchy, watery eyes, sneezing and other similar symptoms.Some people say that a daily tablespoon of honey can actually act like an allergy shot. The type of honey is key though since pasteurized honey does not contain any pollen. For possible seasonal allergy relief, you need to consume raw honey with pollen in it.3. Natural Energy SourceRaw honey contains natural sugars (80 percent), water (18 percent), and minerals, vitamins, pollen and protein (2 percent). It’s not surprising that honey has been called “the perfect running fuel.” It provides an easily absorbed supply of energy in the form of liver glycogen, making it ideal for energetic morning starts and as a pre- and post-exercise energy source. Studies at the University of Memphis Exercise and Sports Nutrition Laboratory have shown honey to be one of the best choices of carbohydrate to consume right before exercising. Additionally, studies have revealed that as a sporting fuel, honey performs on a par with glucose, which is the sugar used in most commercial energy gels.When it comes to raw honey’s use in athletic endeavors, I highly recommend raw honey for both fueling and recovery. That’s why raw honey is included in some of the best pre-workout snacks and post-workout meals.4. Antioxidant PowerhouseStudies have shown that a daily dose of raw honey raises levels of health-promoting antioxidants in the body. Antioxidants help block free radicals in the body that cause disease. It also boosts the immune system, acting as a preventative against any number of diseases. Honey contains polyphenols, which are powerful antioxidants that have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer.One study fed 25 subjects about four tablespoons of honey per day for 29 days in addition to their regular diets. When blood samples were taken at the start and end of the study, researchers found a clear, direct link between honey consumption and an increased level of disease-fighting polyphenols in the blood. Studies have shown that honey contains the disease-fighting antioxidant flavonoids pinocembrin, pinostrobin and chrysin. Pinocembrin supports enzyme activity, and many studies have shown that pinocembrin induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) of many types of cancer cells. Laboratory research suggests that chrysin may increase the male hormone testosterone and improve bodybuilding results, but human research hasn’t found any effect on testosterone levels.5. Sleep PromoterRaw honey promotes restorative sleep in two ways. By consuming honey before bedtime, it restocks the liver’s glycogen supply and prevents the brain from triggering a crisis search for fuel, which can wake you up. Secondly, eating raw honey fosters the release of melatonin in the brain by creating a small spike in insulin levels, which stimulates the release of tryptophan in the brain. Tryptophan converts to serotonin, which is then converted to melatonin. Melatonin also boosts immunity and helps rebuild tissue during periods of rest. Poor sleep, by comparison, has been shown to be a risk factor for hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and arthritis. As honey is a proven natural sleep aid, it naturally lowers the risk of all these health problems.6. Wound and Ulcer HealerHoney-infused bandages are known to aid healing. Peter Charles Molan at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, has found in multiple studies that honey is a natural antibacterial with wound-healing effects. He also found that honey reacts with the body’s fluids to make hydrogen peroxide, creating an inhospitable environment for bacteria. For the treatment of burnsand wounds, honey is typically applied directly to the problem area or in a dressing that’s changed every 24 to 48 hours. Sometimes the dressing is left in place for up to 25 days. (13) A combination of honey and ghee has also been advocated and used as dressing for infected wounds since 1991 in four Mumbai hospitals. Honey has been studied for its use in effectively treating various types of ulcers as well. Honey may reduce the size, pain and odor of problematic skin ulcers. 7. Diabetes AidConsumption of raw honey can reduce the risk of developing diabetes and help aid medication used to treat diabetes. The combination of raw honey and cinnamon can be especially beneficial to healthy blood sugar management, as well as many other health concerns like gingivitis and acne.According to a study out of Dubai, honey has been observed to cause a lower elevation of plasma glucose levels in diabetics compared to dextrose and sucrose. Some suggest that the insulin-boosting power of cinnamon can counteract this glucose elevation in honey, which would make your honey and cinnamon mixture a low glycemic index food combination. Raw honey increases insulin and decreases hyperglycemia. Try consuming a little at a time and see how your blood sugar reacts to it, and add both raw honey and cinnamon to your diabetic diet plan.8. Natural Cough SyrupRaw honey has been shown to be as effective in treating coughs as over-the-counter commercial cough syrups. Increasing scientific evidence shows that a single dose of honey can reduce mucus secretion and coughs. In one study, honey was just as effective as diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan, common ingredients found in over-the counter cough medicines. For a cough, a half teaspoon to two teaspoons of honey at bedtime is a studied and recommended dosage for anyone over the age of one.";" 2963 ";"PureBeeHoney"

"What You Should Know About ASTHMA - Health - Nairaland";"dokita001";"What You Should Know About Asthma!A lot of controversies and discorded opinion are being aired on the issue of the disease called asthma. Asthma is a medical condition that is affecting more and more people everyday. Asthma is a popular chronic inflammatory illness that affects airflow of the lungs. This chronic problem can interfere with a person's enjoyment of life, at the most inopportune times. Medical studies have indicated that out of hundred persons, five will always be infected by asthma. The number is growing especially in the younger population. A person infected with asthma will be plagued by symptoms such as bronchospasm, recurring wheezing, cough, obstruction of the airflow and breath shortness. Symptoms vary (infrequent or mostly during attacks) or can be constant (have the symptoms chronically). To enable them to get more out of life, sufferers of asthma need an effective treatment for asthma attack that will alleviate their symptoms forever. Asthma is caused by inflammation of the bronchioles, or the lungs' air passages. Some substances, such as pollen or smoke, can irritate these passages and trigger an asthma attack. The muscles in the bronchioles constrict, resulting in a build up of mucous and phlegm, which makes it hard to breathe.There are other symptoms of an asthma attack, apart from the obvious difficulty in breathing, and knowing more about all of these symptoms is the first step towards finding a good treatment for asthma attack.*Wheezing* - is usually one of the first signs that a person is having an asthma attack.*Shortness of breath* - no doubt, the most serious and life-threatening symptom of an asthma attack, and one that needs an immediate bronchial asthma remedy.*Coughing* - another distressing symptom that tends to occur during the night or early in the morning.*Chest tightness* - this symptom, alone, usually means that an attack is imminent and as such, a treatment for asthma attack needs to be applied quickly.*Tight neck muscles* - this can really make it difficult for the sufferer to speak.*Chest pains* - whilst this is a common symptom of heart attack, it is also a symptom that is found in 3 out of 4 asthma sufferers.*Rapid heart beat and sweating* - also one of the early indications of asthma attack.Of course, not all symptoms are experienced by every asthma sufferer, but it is essential to be familiar with all the possible signs of an attack, so a bronchial asthma remedy can be readily given. Delaying treatment will only lead to more serious problems and possibly death.A good treatment for asthma attack may not cure the condition forever, but it will enable you to manage and subdue any further attacks effectively. Asthma treatments usually come in oral or vapor forms. Some are long term treatments, such as leukotriene inhibitors, while others are designed to be used only during an attack.If you are experiencing an asthma attack, natural treatment can also work very well. Herbs, such as garlic, sage and tumeric have been known to relieve the symptoms of asthma. Other natural treatments that can help relieve asthma, include hypnotherapy, massage, acupuncture and of course, a healthy diet and regular exercise. Foods that are high in antioxidants and vitamins C and E are the best. Try to reduce, or cut out altogether, sugar and dairy products. Research has also found that probiotics can play a vital role in the treatment for asthma attack because they act as a natural anti-inflammatory.It is important to always have a plan for addressing your (or a loved one's) asthma and keeping up-to-date about the above symptoms and proper treatment is a good start. It is recommended that you consult your physician. However, the truth of the matter is that traditional or alternative therapy has been doing wonders in providing permanent solution to asthma for more than 5,000 years ago, that was what our forefathers used in the olden days and those herbal remedies still work till today and till tomorrow. Take advantage of this and you will be glad you did. It is the Herbal Secret to eliminating Asthma Permanently...Presently, NARV-P is the most effective natural herbal remedy. If you are an Asthma Patient, and you love to have full freedom to live anywhere you like, do any exercise you cherish, be FREE from any breathing difficulties, eat any good food of your choice without any limitation from asthma problem, and conquer asthma and its attack forever, then order for bottles of *NARV-P* by dialling +2349071231489 or Whatsapp +2347066620720 (Nationwide delivery).Life is beautiful but health is wealth...!Have a great weekend!";" 426 ";"dokita001"

You have to know what to do immediately to stop the blood lossMost private hospitals in Lagos are not equipped for major trauma like this, hospitals are in levels, the highest levels are the teaching hospitals in a country.You’d need vascular surgeons,(people who repair vessels) cardiothoracic, general etc, you’d need a whole teamYou’d need blood and fast! Lots of it. Most private hospitals don’t have blood stocked, they have to request for them.A well equipped hospital or emergency centre will have all these I’m not trying to exonerate anyone, I just want you to know how easy it is to die here.You can’t just stitch up a blood vessel, that blood vessel is one of two that sends blood to the brain. It’s also elastic which means that it retracts.

"Investigation: Where Enugu Pregnant Women Seek Antenatal Care, Delivery - Health - Nairaland";"okeychris";"Inadequate staffing, poor infrastructure and others pose concern to mothers, children and other residents in accessing basic healthcare in Enugu State. Okechukwu Onuegbu explores this in this investigative report.On Wednesday June 15, 2017, when Mrs Anastasia Nworie was in labour at about 9pm, she sought for a local midwife or Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) in her community, Nachi, Udi LGA. Luckily, she was successfully delivered of a male child, Chizaram. Nachi has one Heath Centre at Enugu-Ameke village serving her four villages. The health centre, which shares boundary with Community Primary School, Enugu-Ameke is an edifice with a waiting room, now turned to immunisation office.It lies in the heart of the bush, far away from home, very lonely unless when the primary school besides it is in session. Although it currently has solar powered refrigerator for immunisation purposes, other facilities like water, ultrasound machine, alternative power supply, security and others were unavailable. It was not even fenced, making its workers non-resident. It was learnt that the poor village women manage to visit the health centre mostly for immunisation or antenatal care purposes. But when it comes to delivery, they either seek help elsewhere like TBA, private hospitals or travel to Udi General Hospital. When visited on November 11, 2019, not even a signpost was found for easy location. The route to the health centre has only two signposts, Community Primary School, Enugu-Ameke and Living Christ Mission. The deplorable road took this reporter almost 30 minutes by trekking. Two female nurses and a male in mufti were seen. The supposedly officer-in-charge of the facility, who introduced self as ‘nurse Ikeorah’ told our disguised reporter they report to work every day. But, during our repeated visit at 12.15pm on 18th November, the health centre was under lock and key. A woman farming beside it told our reporter they left ‘few minutes ago.’Like in Nachi, most public Health Centres visited in Enugu state are inaccessible to pregnant women. At Ukehe, Igbo-Etiti LGA, a pregnant teacher, Mrs Tina Eze, complained that she was referred to a private hospital when she developed complication at Ukehe Primary Healthcare Centre in 2017 due to insufficient facilities. Her two children were reportedly delivered in the health centre but the third one did not come out even after rupture of the membrane. She was subsequently referred to a private hospital where a baby boy came out through Caesarian Section (CS). She claimed to have spent about N20,000 for the CS instead of N3,500 the health centre would have allegedly charged her for normal delivery.She might be lucky compared to Umulungbe (Udi LGA) where pregnant women seek medical care in neighbouring communities. In 2018, a woman was said to have  lost two children to complication after a ‘successful’ delivery in one of the existing TBA in the community. Umulungbe parked into Akpato Health Centre, a building where work is in progress, in October 2019. The edifice, built by the community with support from the Enugu state ministry of health, was a shadow of itself when visited on November 14.Likewise, Mrs Cynthia Chuks, who was delivered of a baby boy on May 21, 2019, at a private hospital in Enugu alleged that her husband relocated her to the city after receiving antenatal care at Awgwu health centre in Awgwu LGA due to inadequate facilities.These were despite budgetary allocations to the health sector every fiscal year. The capital expenditure for the Ministry of Health in 2019 was N1,112,200,000; N212,400,000 for Enugu State Hospitals Management Board; Enugu State Primary Healthcare Agency (N300,300,000). Also the recurrent expenditure for the ministry of health in 2017 was N398,995,191; N472,371,131 for 2018; and N275,037,904 in 2019. However, the recurrent expenditure for Enugu State Primary Health Care was zero in 2017, N96,900,000 in 2018, and N114,900,000 in 2019, while those of State Health Board stood at N1,283,299,426 in 2017, N2,367,664,084 in 2018, and N2,367,664,084 in 2019. In 2018, the detailed budgeted capital receipt of the state indicated that N50,000,000 was expected for Health Reform Programme (Free Maternal and Child Health programme (FMCH) but was probably not spent as the column for ‘Actual’ on the budget read ‘zero’.Enugu state government, it would be recalled, claimed to be running FMCH at the state Health Centres and General Hospitals. According to a report published on the state ministry of health website, FMCH, which began in 2007 was a policy aimed at providing free medical, antenatal, delivery and post-natal care to poor women and children in primary and secondary hospitals, and those referred to tertiary hospitals in the State. Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi while presenting the 2019 budget estimate of N109, 199 billion to the state House of Assembly last December, said his administration was committed to sustaining and improving on it. He allocated N2.37 billion to health ministry. A total of N50,000,000 was allocated for the FMCH programme in 2019.To find out how these budgetary allocations were utilised in improving the state of Health centres especially as concerned maternal care in Enugu State, prompted this investigation across 3 senatorial districts namely: Enugu East, Enugu West and Enugu North. Three LGAs were visited in each of these zones. They include Nkanu West, Enugu North, Enugu South, Ezeagu, Oji River, Udi, Igbo-etiti, Nsukka, and Udenu.At each of these LGAs, the reporter accessed two communities or two health centres and General Hospitals (where possible). They were Nachi Health centre; Udi General (district) Hospital; Akpato Health centre (Umulumgbe); Basic health centre and maternity, Mile 2 Orji river; Oji River General Hospital; Agungu Health Centre; Isiagu-Umumba Ndiagu health centre; Agba Umana Health centre; Ogui Nike Health Centre; and Poly Clinic (Poly General Hospital) Asata.Others include Uwani Health Centre; Akpugo Agu health centre; Ndiuno Uwani Health Centres and quarters (Akpugo); Ozalla Health centre; Umueze Health centre; Model Health Centre (Agbamere ward) Eha Alumona; Ukehe Primary Healthcare centre; Orba ward model primary health care centre; and Imilikenu Health centre.Findings:The investigation revealed that most of the state health centres fall below the  minimum standard for the primary level of health care facilities approved by National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA, Ward Health system 2018) which include that building and premises must have two rooms with cross ventilation, walls and roof must be in good condition, functional separate male and female toilet facilities with water supply within the premises, a waste disposal site, be clearly signposted, among others.It was also learnt that the workers demand registration fees of between N1000 to N2000 despite the claim by the Enugu state government that they were running FMCH. This enrollment fees allegedly cover opening of folder, cards, and prenatal laboratory tests such as hepatitis, genotype and malaria, blood group, HIV, Sphilis, routine drugs, others. Some nurses and pregnant women allegedly pegged N3500 to N5000 as charges for normal delivery. Some of the nurses equally claimed that the FMCH programme was suspended three years ago owing to the fact that the state government was no longer supplying them with free drugs.But women do not really bother about the payments. All they want is optimum service delivery. Mrs Georgina Madu, a volunteer labourer at Isiagwu Umumba-Ndiagu Health centre lamented that the only public Health center in the community of five villages, was in shamble. “It has only two old beds, no light, no water and useful drugs. Only two nurses work there. And they don’t live in the vicinity because of bushy environment. This is why my children took my husband to Enugu for treatment two days ago. They have no toilet and bathroom. So, you see why pregnant women come for immunisation there and seek better place while in labour,” added, Mrs Madu.The entrance gate into the Health Centre was locked when visited at exactly 12noon on Friday 15th November. A notice pasted on the gate revealed that the nurse on duty travelled to Aguobu-Owa, Eziagu LGA headquarters for a training since 14th November. The phone numbers on the post was called three times without response. A Short Message Service (SMS) “Hello, my wife is on labour and I can’t see you. Do you advice I wait or take her to somewhere else,” was sent to it. No reply. But at 4.38pm she returned her calls. This reporter, who was indisposed, contacted her back at 5.20pm only for the receiver (a female voice) to say she had been on a training since 14th November.At Agba Umana Health centre, no one was sighted as at 2.15pm on November 15. The two phone numbers found on the Health Centre’s nurses’ duty roaster hanged on a wall were switched off as at 2.49pm. The documents further showed that two nurses manned the facility on shift basis. It was equally observed that the Health Centre was last renovated in 2010, while its perimeter fencing was abandoned halfway for a year or more.Also, there were no accommodation for nurses in the environment full of grasses. The ceiling and window (glass lobes) of the building suggested that they had security threats. A peep through some vandalised windows showed that it has ten old beds, no power supply, among others.The story was the same at Ukehe Primary Healthcare centre, where every pregnant woman desiring to be delivered of her baby, reportedly supply power and water. Their power generating set and borehole allegedly stopped working less than a year after its construction. It was also learnt the centre has nine staff, all work in two persons pay shift. Their solar powered refrigerator for immunisation was dysfunctional.“This place leaks whenever it rains. This uncompleted perimeter fence had been here for over six years. As you can see, the alternative power supply machine installed about six years ago had been overtaken by bush. It was not used for once because the contractor locked up the equipment alleging he was owed by government,” a junior staff of the health centre bemaoned.The health centre has no signpost, even as its nurses and doctors quarters were not inhabited due to the bushy environment and unavailability of doctor. The two elderly security men working in the centre were appointed by an undisclosed politician on salary scale of N5000 each per month.Basic centre and maternity, Mile 2 Orji river; and Ogui Nike Health Centre (renovated on October 3, 2000), visited on November 11 and November 12 respectively, although fenced, have untidy environment as well as lack security, alternative power supply, among others. Agungu Health Centre visited on November 11 was still inhabiting an old building situated in uncompleted perimeter fence abandoned about five years ago, with no nurses and doctors' accommodation. Thus, its staff leave office from 6pm daily and could only attend to women in labour at night if previously arranged for.Similarly, Ndiuno Uwani Health Centres and quarters (Akpugo); Ozalla Health centre; Umueze Health centre; and Imilikenu Health centre, all lack perimeter fence, security and water supply to boost their works. It was gathered that these health centres including Model Health Centre (Agbamere ward) Eha Alumona have insufficient staff.  A source at Model Health Centre (Agbamere ward) whose entrance gate had dilapidated, added that power supply, solar refrigerator, security and drugs were their major concern.A nurse met at Imilikenu health centre said they fetch water from someone’s house close to the institution as their water facility had gone moribund. The water scheme sited at the health centre by the Enugu state government as a client with the assistant of Water Aid had been overran by grasses. At Akpugo health centre (Akpugo Agu) fenced with doctor and nurses accommodations, lack alternative power supply having allegedly lost one to hoodlums. Also, it seemed to be lacking renovation after been commissioned on April 29, 2005.As a result of these challenges noticed in rural health centres, urban based general hospitals like Udi hospital, and Poly Clinic (Poly General Hospital), including the newly renovated Orba ward model primary health centre and Uwani Health centres, were observed to be usually busy and crowded during immunisation and antenatal cares. This was the case with Poly Clinic where a mammoth crowd of pregnant women and nursing mothers were seen either sitting or standing on November 13. Attempts to speak with the Enugu state Commissioner for Health was futile as this reporter could not see him in office when visited on November 12, 14, 19, 21, 26 and 28. However, when contacted, the Executive Secretary, Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr George Ugwu, said he was appointed recently to head the agency, which according to him was recently assigned a supervisory role to all the health centres for optimum service delivery.Ugwu, who said the state government recently re-positioned some health centres in the state as model primary facilities namely those in Abakpa, Uwani, Oji River and Obollor, said the state government was doing everything necessary to revamp primary health care centres in the state with a vision to take health care need of people across communities.";" 55 ";"okeychris"

"Sexual Health: Squirting What It Is, And Where It Comes From - Health - Nairaland";"blacbard";"Few hours ago, a tweet made the rounds on Twitter of a guy drinking squirted fluid from MouthAction with a woman, some people squirmed at the sight of it and called it disgusting, a lady mentioned that there is no difference between that and someone swallowing semen from a man. This prompted a reply from someone that Squirting is essentially the release of urine, this led to a long back and forth argument on what squirting exactly is. Squirting is now a much aspired to phenomenon in this age and is perceived by some people as something a woman should be able to do, or the peak of female sexual stimulation.So, I guess you will be asking, what is squirting and where does the fluid come from?Different studies (self-reported) showed that this phenomenon occurred in about 40 – 50% of respondents, which shows that it is far much common than a lot of people will think. The answers concerning the origin of the liquid varied and few women know the nature of the fluidLet us first bring things to perspective, female ejaculation and squirting are not the same thing, they are two different occurrences that occur from sexual stimulation in women. Female ejaculation is the release of fluid from some glands in the female, it is thick and whitish, it’s more like the ejaculate in men by comparison. Squirting on the other hand is the release of a urine-esque fluid from the bladder through the urethra, mixed with sex gland fluids in a lot of cases.  These two come out from different places in the female private area. Studies done by Salama showed that the Squirt is essentially urine and can happen for a lot of reasons in different women, some women find it embarrassing, some find it exciting and pleasurable. For women who do not wish to emit this liquid, because of embarrassment or because of the management of bedding, Salama suggests urinating before (or during a break during) sexual intercourse.

"5 Simple Tricks To Control Your Ejaculation - Health - Nairaland";"markbor";"There is in principle no impotent man! There are, however, men who don't understand their body's signals.   1.    Ballooning is an exercise in holding back your ejaculations which some say may increase the ability of how much blood your member can hold while you are fully erect. 2.    While sitting in a chair tighten and contract you pelvic muscle as though you are trying to hold back from urinating. Hold for as many seconds as you can, release, wait a minute or so and repeat. Do this exercise a couple times per day. These exercises will take no time to strengthen your control muscles. 3.    You need to practice. When you masturbate and are about to cum, try to hold it back. Second, when you need to pee start peeing and when you are half way done STOP for a second then start. Doing this every once in a while will help build your mussels down there for better control. 4.    When you are having sex with your wife and you feeling like you going to ejaculate pull down on your balls. Your testicles rise when you are about to ejaculate. Lowering them will ease the sensation. 5.      The fact is... premature ejaculation is almost always caused by too much mental stimulation. Always thinking about your premature ejaculation can lead to performance anxiety. Your mind controls what happens when you're about to have sex. So you have to start there if you want to change your situation. In other words, you MUST first change your thoughts. When a man can’t choose when to ejaculate during sexual intercourse, it becomes a problem for both him and his partner.

"4 Levels Of Premature Ejaculation - How To Determine Yours - Health - Nairaland";"markbor";"Level 1.Very common among teenagers, this level is characterized by poor masturbation habits during adolescence and preadolescence. Masturbating quickly, out of fear of being caught by someone, defeats the purpose of the ejaculatory reflex, replacing it with the need or the habit of quickly reaching orgasm. This Level is the one that is most easily and quickly solved. By following the appropriate treatment the patient can fully recover within a few daysLevel 2.In general, it affects young adults and, in some cases, teenagers. This Level of PE is caused by stress, anxiety, or emotional tension. Work-related or personal problems, including a demanding routine at school, may trigger Level 2 PE without any warning. Similarly to Level 1 PE this can also be easily treated when diagnosed in time.Level 3.This Level of PE is mainly caused due to development from an untreated or poorly treated Level 2 PE. Rarely, it also spontaneously affects young adults under stress. The cause of this problem is a permanent unbalance between the serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain, which excessively increases the impulse that triggers the ejaculatory reflex. This degree of PE must be immediately treated since there is a risk it may progress into a sexual disorder*, which is immensely more complexLevel 4.This is the most severe PE Level, because it turns into a disorder and there are only a few online treatment alternatives that will help solve the problem. This case usually requires the direct help of a professional.It is time that sex became satisfying for you. It is time that you could actually stay longer in your bedroom to get exactly what you desire and need from getting close with the woman that you love the most without having to depend on drugs or pills.For ADVANCED “Natural” Techniques to permanently cure your premature ejaculation & maintain hard erection once and for all, email irabormark@gmail.com  to download the Free report  titled “Natural Cure For Premature Ejaculation & Ed.Is this MONSTER Affecting your marriage?

The Governor also laid the foundation of a new main teaching hospital complex, as part of his determination to make the teaching hospital in the state a world-class modern tertiary facility. According to Arakunrin Akeredolu, Ondo State was hitherto the only State without a tertiary health care facility among the South western states in Nigeria. He noted that the state has not only surpassed the other States in terms of improvement in health delivery indices, but has also gotten accreditation in all its clinical service departments in a record time of one year.”We have equally reversed the trend of Ondo State indigenes and residents of the State seeking tertiary health care outside the State.” the Governor said. Arakunrin Akeredolu explained that his administration passed into law the establishment of the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Complex (UNIMEDTHC, adding that the  Law amalgamated existing specialist hospitals to form a Multi-Complex Teaching Hospital, named University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital Complex for the already existing University of Medical Sciences.He said:” We ingeniously sourced medical equipment at a reduced cost to cover identified infrastructural gaps in all our hospitals. This has improved diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of all our public hospitals.”We passed into Law the Primary Health Care Bill to empower the Primary Health  Care Board to carry out its work more effectively and efficiently. This will also position us to benefit from the National Basic Health Fund which will, in turn, improve the health wellbeing of our citizens at the community level.”The State Government, in order to improve the capacity of our primary training Health Institution in the State has also upgraded the School of Health Technology, Akure into a degree-awarding College of Health Technology.  The college is now better positioned to train health personnel. We intend to improve the infrastructural facilities at the College.”We passed into law the bill incorporating the School of Nursing and Midwifery into the University of Medical Sciences. This singular act has enriched the training of our nurses in compliance with the aspirations of the Nursing  Councils.”Following the amalgamation of the facilities, we have reorganized, restructured and embarked upon building new structures to have a modern and standard teaching hospital.”We have also recruited highly qualified personnel to match the upgrade in the facility. We have recruited over 750 personnel across board.”We are also providing more ambulances, buses and services vehicles to ease movement of staff and patients across the three complexes of the Teaching Hospital.”We have also decided to acquire some neighbouring buildings to allow for further expansion of the Akure Complex of the Teaching Hospital.

Chronic heartburn can cause permanent damage to the esophagus, but even if you just get hit after overindulging in rich or spicy food, the pain is enough to make you crazy.Baking soda can neutralize stomach acid and provide rapid relief from acid reflux. Just dissolve a teaspoon of it in some cold water and drink the mixture slowly. (Gulping it can lead to a lot of froth in your stomach that will make you feel bloated.)2. Freshen Breath & Whiten TeethBaking soda is an excellent tool for oral care as well. Studies show that toothpaste containing baking soda is better at breaking down plaque and whitening teeth than toothpaste without it. But you don’t necessarily have to buy the toothpaste to enjoy the benefits. You can make a small amount of paste with baking soda and water, and then dip your toothbrush right in there before brushing.Baking soda also has strong antibacterial and antimicrobial properties that make it an excellent mouthwash. Just ½ teaspoon of baking soda in half a glass of water is enough – swish it around your mouth and spit it out just as you would any other mouthwash. The mixture is great for reaching crevices between and around teeth that might be missed while brushing.3. Treat Canker SoresCanker sores cause a lot of pain for how tiny they are! They are simply small circular ulcers that form inside the mouth (not on the lips). They aren’t contagious and often occur after a period of overindulging in rich food. Canker sores usually heal by themselves but can be quite uncomfortable until they do.If you are bothered by a canker sore, use the baking soda mouthwash we described in #2 – ½ teaspoon baking soda dissolved in a half cup of water – on a daily basis. Research indicates that this can significantly reduce the pain as well as speed healing.4. Use as DeodorantDeodorant is another product that often contains baking soda because it is excellent at absorbing odors. This is the same reason that some people leave an open box of the stuff in their refrigerators or bathrooms. It works because of its antimicrobial properties.Did you know that human sweat is actually odorless? It only starts to smell when the bacteria on our skin begin to break it down into acidic waste products. Baking soda doesn’t fully halt this process, but it makes the result significantly less acidic and therefore, less pungent. Try patting some onto your armpits in a pinch as a natural deodorant.5. Rock Your WorkoutBaking soda is actually quite popular among endurance athletes. Certain studies have shown that baking soda allows you to perform at your peak for a longer period, especially during high-intensity training. During this type of exercise, your muscle cells produce something called lactic acid. Lactic acid is the reason you feel a burning sensation while exercising hard. It also lowers the pH inside your cells, which causes the muscles to fatigue.Baking soda has a high pH and can compensate somewhat for the lactic acid. This may help keep you going longer. One study found that people who ingested some baking soda before exercising went for about 4.5 minutes longer than those who didn’t. Remember that this is 4.5 minutes longer at peak exertion. It may not sound like a lot in terms of an everyday workout, but when you’re running a race, it can make all the difference.6. Soothe Itchy Skin and SunburnsBaking soda is a good treatment for all kinds of skin ailments. It is especially good at taking the chronic itchiness and irritation out of bug bites and stings. For this, make a thick paste with baking soda and water and apply it to the affected areas.If your itchy skin is the result of sunburn, try a baking soda bath. Simply add 1-2 of baking soda to a warm (not hot) bath. Then soak for at least 30 minutes, making sure that the affected areas are completely covered. Some evidence suggests that sunburns respond even better when cornstarch and oatmeal are added to the bath as well.7. Soften CallusesCalluses are hard, rough patches of skin that form in areas that receive consistent pressure or friction. Guitarists have distinctive calluses on their hands, for example. Calluses are also common on the feet because they are frequently under pressure. Any consistent repetitive action can tend to cause calluses at the point of impact.Calluses are not dangerous; in fact, they are protective. But sometimes they can be unsightly or uncomfortable and you may want to soften or reduce them. Baking soda can help with that, too. Soaking in a baking soda bath can relieve soreness and soften calluses enough to shave off rough spots.ConclusionBaking soda is probably one of the most versatile ingredients in your kitchen, great for baking, cleaning, and health and beauty purposes. These 7 benefits are just the start of what you can do with baking soda – it is also a key ingredient in those working volcano models everyone has to do in school at some point!Since it is also extremely inexpensive, buy a couple of boxes to keep in various places throughout your house. That way you can always find some when you need to treat a canker sore, whiten your teeth, or soak away the aches of a long day.https://www.tophealthblog.com/benefits-of-baking-soda/";" 211 ";"amebovillage"

"Patrick Sawyer's Widow Apologises To Adadevoh's Family - Health - Nairaland";"korel9";"Decontee Sawyer, the widow of late late Liberian, Patrick Sawyer, the man who brought the deadly Ebola disease to Nigeria, says she regrets the death of Doctor Ameyo Adadevor of First Consultant Hospital, who died of the Ebola virus on Tuesday August 19th after being infected by Sawyer. In an email to Leadership.ng, Mrs Sawyer, who lives in Minnesota, USA, said she's pained that her late husband caused so many others so much pain both in Liberia and Nigeria. ""I share the pains that the family members of the Nigerian doctor are going through. It is just a pity that Patrick had to cause this damage both in Liberia and Nigeria.” Continue.. ""I want to reach out to them and express how deeply saddened and sorry I am for their loss and their pain. I do apologise if my words have cost anyone who is grieving more pain. I fall on my knees and ask God for his healing power for all of those who are still infected with Ebola. I pray for all of the families whose loved ones were taken away by this merciless killer Ebola, especially those affected by Patrick’s actions. “Ebola didn’t start with Patrick in Liberia, as we both know. Ebola was in Liberia from a traveller from Guinea since February of this year. The government knew about it and did nothing. Many Liberians, including me, called out to the government then to close the borders. They didn’t do so until one of their own, Patrick (Sawyer), died in July. “Many people died before Patrick and their lives were just as important. That is my frustration. Ebola didn’t have to go to Nigeria, Africa’s most populated country, had the Liberian government taken drastic actions sooner. I, too, have family members and friends in Nigeria, and now they are at risk because of Patrick’s actions. “In spite of my anger and disappointment with him, I don’t believe that he did this with evil intent (I could be wrong). I believe his actions were that of a desperate man. And sad for everyone involved, Nigeria was closer than the U.S. This is just my take on what he could have been thinking (of course, I could be wrong). “My regret is that I was so caught up in my own pain and frustration, that I neglected to see the pain of the innocent people both in Liberia and Nigeria who are affected by Patrick’s actions. For that, I am deeply sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was to cause them pain. It is a pain I know. It is a pain I don’t want them to have.”http://leadership.ng/news/381660/im-sorry-adadevohs-pain";" 32134 ";"Nobody"

"Prostatitis Therapy: What Are The Advantages And Disadvantages Of Various Treatm - Health - Nairaland";"Alexanderrrr";"Prostatitis is a disease that plagues many males within the yrs and patients experience a lot for doing this. Individuals seek out a number of treatments in the hope of curing it rather than suffering from it anymore. It is roughly approximated that more than 80% of individuals with prostatitis have experienced secondary therapy.Speaking of this, some prostatitis patients, particularly those with long-term prostatitis may have a issue: the reason why prostatitis so difficult to deal with? Why cannot it be cured at one time? Today we have been here to offers the benefits and drawbacks of countless frequent treatment solutions for prostatitis.1. Contemporary medication Anti-biotics tend to be used in the treating of long-term prostatitis in Traditional western medication. It is convenient to consider and effectively reduce the inflammation, however its drawbacks are that it is hard to make it to the hospital. It could not generate a highly effective healing focus within the prostatic gland, hence impacting the curative effect. When the amount is greater, the side results of Western medicine will be great, and it is possible to damage the liver and renal and other important bodily organs.Mouth prescription antibiotics are hard to reach the lesion, which depends on the structure of the prostate. Even though prostate gland is actually a little organ, it is crucial for males, and so the organism also greater its security for the prostate. You will find a fibrous envelope around the prostate, that is so adaptable and dense that it is referred to as prostate barrier.Experts through pet experiments think that penicillin kanamycin, G, ampicillin and oxytetracycline along with other anti-biotics can hardly go into the prostate. Only a few anti-biotics, such as erythromycin, bambooneomycin and chloramphenicol, and lincomycin, can diffuse in to the prostate by plasma. These drugs are efficient against Gram-good microorganisms, but the majority of the pathogens of prostatitis are Gram-bad microorganisms, therefore the efficacy of these drugs is not really excellent.Even though chloramphenicol and tetracycline can penetrate into the prostate, they may be successful only when they are extremely responsive to germs, therefore improving the trouble of therapy.2. Surgical procedure The key operative treatment options of benign prostatic hyperplasia are to eliminate the glandular hyperplasia part to ease urinary tract blockage. Surgical treatment is acceptable for individuals with benign prostatic hyperplasia of period II or over. The medical-period depends on the degree of the signs. Phase I: It is usually manifested asdysuria and polyuria, weak urine circulation, compensatory hypertrophy of detrusor muscle of bladder, but no retention of urine. Stage II: bladder begins to decompensate, urinary retention occurs, and bacterial cystitis often takes place.Stage III: the bladder is decompensated for a long time, urinary preservation is serious, and renal insufficiency occurs.Conservative treatment is ineffective once the prostate enlarges to period III or reaches period III. Traditional western treatments promoters prompt operation in the early stage. The main benefit of operation is always to resect the prostate hyperplasia, reduce urinary tract obstruction and achieve quick outcomes.Nonetheless, the disadvantage is there are several issues, a few of which have severe consequences. Furthermore, they are able to recur after an operation. At the same time, the pain of procedure is another worry for many seniors individuals, so it will be hard for individuals to just accept.Frequent complications are: 1) Urinary tract disease2) Secondary epididymitis, seminal vesicle swelling and prostatitis3) Urinary fistula Second to incision contamination and reduce urinary tract obstruction.4) Dysuria due to incorrect operation, rough functioning and infection, urethral stricture and bladder neck area stricture was triggered.5) Urinary incontinence brought on by the Medical injury in the external urethral sphincter of smooth muscle across the prostate of the bladder throat.6) urethrorectal fistula as a result of Injury in the rectal wall during operation.7) Intimate dysfunction Whatever type of operation is adopted, the penile erectile neurological can be broken and controlled to varying diplomas, causing erectile dysfunction.3. Traditional Chinese Medication Standard Chinese medicine mainly treats prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia according to syndrome differentiation. Folks can usually be treated with oral all-natural medication along with herbal fumigation, nearby management of rectum and acupuncture, massage therapy, urethra and thus on.In comparison with Western medication, conventional Chinese medication has obvious benefits in the treating of prostatic diseases.Conventional Chinese treatments therapy for prostatitis are diverse, all kinds of treatments are safe and trustworthy, non-dangerous, benign without side effects, such as mouth organic medicine Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill, that is simple to consider, it features a good effect of clearing heat and cleansing, marketing the circulation of blood, advertising qi and reducing soreness, and bactericidal and anti-inflammatory result as wide-spectrum anti-biotics of chemical treatments.Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill can fundamentally treat prostatitis, meanwhile, it can improve the immune system of patients.

"Akeredolu Commissions New Critical Care Unit Building For UNIMEDTHC (photos) - Health - Nairaland";"OndoTrends";"Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu,SAN, has commissioned the newly-built Critical Care Unit (CCU) Building at the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital Complex (UNIMEDTHC), Akure, the state capital. The Governor also laid the foundation of a new main teaching hospital complex, as part of his determination to make the teaching hospital in the state a world-class modern tertiary facility. According to Arakunrin Akeredolu, Ondo State was hitherto the only State without a tertiary health care facility among the South western states in Nigeria. He noted that the state has not only surpassed the other States in terms of improvement in health delivery indices, but has also gotten accreditation in all its clinical service departments in a record time of one year.”We have equally reversed the trend of Ondo State indigenes and residents of the State seeking tertiary health care outside the State.” the Governor said. Arakunrin Akeredolu explained that his administration passed into law the establishment of the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Complex (UNIMEDTHC, adding that the  Law amalgamated existing specialist hospitals to form a Multi-Complex Teaching Hospital, named University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital Complex for the already existing University of Medical Sciences.He said:” We ingeniously sourced medical equipment at a reduced cost to cover identified infrastructural gaps in all our hospitals. This has improved diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of all our public hospitals.”We passed into Law the Primary Health Care Bill to empower the Primary Health  Care Board to carry out its work more effectively and efficiently. This will also position us to benefit from the National Basic Health Fund which will, in turn, improve the health wellbeing of our citizens at the community level.”The State Government, in order to improve the capacity of our primary training Health Institution in the State has also upgraded the School of Health Technology, Akure into a degree-awarding College of Health Technology.  The college is now better positioned to train health personnel. We intend to improve the infrastructural facilities at the College.”We passed into law the bill incorporating the School of Nursing and Midwifery into the University of Medical Sciences. This singular act has enriched the training of our nurses in compliance with the aspirations of the Nursing  Councils.”Following the amalgamation of the facilities, we have reorganized, restructured and embarked upon building new structures to have a modern and standard teaching hospital.”We have also recruited highly qualified personnel to match the upgrade in the facility. We have recruited over 750 personnel across board.”We are also providing more ambulances, buses and services vehicles to ease movement of staff and patients across the three complexes of the Teaching Hospital.”We have also decided to acquire some neighbouring buildings to allow for further expansion of the Akure Complex of the Teaching Hospital. These buildings are too close to the hospitals and the occupants are in possible health jeopardy.”Olabode Richard OlatundeSpecial Assistant to the Governor (New Media)December 3, 2019";" 35 ";"OndoTrends"

The Governor also declared that his administration will employ more Medical Doctors and Nurses and also upgrade the physical infrastructure of the seven designated Mother-and-Child friendly hospitals across the state.Governor Akeredolu said both the Contributory Health Scheme and the Abiyamo Maternal and Child Health Insurance Scheme are evidence of his administration’s commitment to the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with a consciousness of a sustainable framework of healthcare financing. Governor Akeredolu, who performed the flag-off at the Mother and Child Hospital, Akure, said the State Executive Council, last year agreed and approved the payment of premium for the healthcare benefits of all under-5 children and pregnant women resident in the State to the Ondo State Contributory Health Commission’s pool. He said the state is leading by example through the gesture to make contributions on behalf of pregnant women and under-5 children in order to ensure that maternal and under-5 children health services are free at the point of care. The Governor noted that the Residency card (Kaadi Igbeayo) remains the prerequisite to benefit from the Abiyamo Maternal and Child Health insurance Scheme (AMCHIS). He disclosed that the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) has positioned its officers at strategic locations in the seven designated Mother and Child-friendly Hospitals to register and issue the Residency Card to pregnant women free of charge. Arakunrin Akeredolu said: ""First, we have christened it the Abiyamo Health Insurance Scheme of Ondo State, pointing to the fact that a model of health insurance is adopted to drive and sustain the scheme.“Secondly, we have expanded the scope of providers from the two Mother-and-Child Hospitals in Akure and Ondo city (both in the Central Senatorial District) in the past, to additional five secondary facilities, including State Specialist Hospital, Ikare-Akoko and General Hospital, Owo in the Northern Senatorial District; General Hospital, Ore, State Specialist Hospital, Okitipupa and General Hospital Igbokoda in the Southern Senatorial District. Residents of the State in the remaining 11 LGAs can also access any of these seven selected hospitals that is close to them.”Permit me to state that our administration started this journey when we sent a bill to the State House of Assembly in 2018 to establish the Ondo State Contributory Health Scheme (ODCHS) and Ondo State Contributory Health Commission (ODCHC).“I signed the bill into law in the same year and the office complex of ODCHC was formally commissioned on the 24th of June, 2019.

She discussed this cosmetic procedure on the E! reality show, Botched. The procedure of a pubic hair eyelash transplant may sound odd for some, however, the results speak for themselves and now this type of transplant is being performed by Nigerian Born Doctor (Dr Sanusi Umar - Dr. U) at his clinic in Manhattan Beach, CA. The VeeLashe™ pubic hair eyelash transplant procedure is performed using Dr. U’s patented Dr.UGraft™ FUE hair transplant system, which has the unique ability to extract all types of hair from the body, including hair from the pubic area. Dr. U found that the characteristics of pubic hair resemble that of a natural eyelash. For example, the pubic hair follicle features a cross-sectional shape which gives the hair its wiry texture. On the other hand, head hair follicles feature a circular shape which does not recreate the look of natural, curly lashes. To those women  who are tired of the rigorous maintenance routine required of eyelash extensions, fake lashes, and conventional transplants,  VeeLashe™ may be the solution.  According to Dr U, VeeLashe™ results are typically fuller and more natural looking with minimal maintenance required.";" 49 ";"DrULifestyle"

But then, bitter kola works exceptional in spiritual practices.However, take note that bitter kola doesn’t make appearance in any ritual that has to do with progress unlike what we have with a kolanut and others.Anytime you see a spiritualist performing a ritual with bitter kola, it stands for negativity.We use bitter kola for destruction of spells and other missions.There are simple rituals you can perform with bitter kola.

"5 Nutritional Facts About Almonds And Walnuts - Health - Nairaland";"gideonjeta";"Nuts are known to have high fat content hence why many people avoid them in their diets but scientific evidence suggests that 1.5 ounces a day of nuts like almonds and walnuts, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may decrease your risk of heart disease.This was made known by the United States Food and Drug Administration that believes adding a few nutrient-rich almonds and walnuts to your daily diet is a tasty way to give your body a healthful boost.Nuts are the go to when you need something that provides a natural burst of energy, protein, and fiber.Thanks to their nutritional values, there has been a long standing debate as to which is better when it comes to almonds and walnuts. Keep reading below to learn some nutritional facts about almonds and walnuts.Energy content:Walnuts contain a slightly higher amount of fat than almonds but provide more energy in the form of calories. Almonds contain 14 grams of fat and 164 calories whereas walnuts contain approximately 18 grams of fat but give 185 calories.Protein content:Almonds contain 13% of protein while walnuts have 9% which makes both great sources of protein.Mineral content:Both almonds and walnuts are rich in various kinds of minerals like calcium,magnesium and potassium but almonds have a higher content in all three categories than walnuts. Almonds pack 19% magnesium – essential for strong bones, compared to the 11% in walnuts. Walnuts, however, have very high amounts of copper (50%) and manganese (54%) which prove to be useful in reducing symptoms of PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome) as compared to almonds. Almonds also contain 200 milligrams of potassium per 1-ounce serving compared to the 125 milligrams in walnuts, as well as 76 milligrams of magnesium compared to the 45 milligrams in walnuts.Fibre content:Almonds contain 16% fiber whereas walnuts have 8%.Vitamin content:While walnuts contain 12% vitamin B6, compared to the 3% in almonds. Almonds contain almost 48% vitamin E whereas walnuts contain only about 2% of the same. On the other hand, while almonds have no B vitamins, walnuts contain a trace amount of vitamin B-6.In addition to their nutrient-rich contribution, a study published in “Nutrition & Metabolism” in January 2011 found that eating almonds along with a high glycemic index food lowers the GI of the entire meal and reduces the rise in blood sugar after eating. And walnuts, according to University of Michigan Health Center, are the only nuts that contain a large amount plant-based omega-3 fatty acid.https://www.nigerialog.com/health/5-nutritional-facts-about-almonds-and-walnuts/new/#new";" 67 ";"gideonjeta"

"Kids With No Teeth: What Causes Delays In Tooth Eruption? - Health - Nairaland";"Dentalgist";"New parents watch with anticipation for the tiny white bud that signals the arrival of baby’s first tooth. So when teeth don’t appear, it’s normal to wonder if there is something wrong. Whereas for most kids with no teeth, this delay is not something to worry about, there may be underlying causes for this condition in some infants.When Do Teeth Usually Appear?Babies are born with most of their teeth already formed within their gums, and they usually begin to appear by the age of six months. The two lower front teeth emerge first, followed by the four upper front teeth, then the remaining two lower front teeth. The rest generally arrive two at a time – one on each side of the mouth – and by the age of three, nearly all children have a complete set of 20 primary teeth.When Is a Delay Considered Abnormal?Kids with no teeth by the age of 18 months should be taken to see a dentist, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Four to 15 months of age is the normal range for the appearance of the first tooth, and the other teeth usually follow in a regular schedule. Most children have four teeth by the time they are 11 months old, eight teeth at 15 months, 12 teeth at 19 months, 16 teeth at 23 months and 20 teeth at 27 months. Permanent teeth begin to appear around six years of age. Teeth that do not follow this normal eruption pattern aren’t necessarily a concern, but no teeth at all can indicate more advanced problems in a few cases.What Causes It?A number of things may be to blame when a child’s tooth eruption falls outside the normal schedule. Sometimes, late tooth eruption is simply a family trait. Preemie and low-birthweight babies may also experience delayed tooth eruption, and the teeth can have enamel defects that come with it. Research cited in the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics suggests some rare genetic abnormalities that cause poorly formed teeth and late tooth appearance as well, such as amelogenesis imperfecta and regional odontodysplasia. Nutritional deficiency and Vitamin D-resistant rickets can also cause a delay, though it may be a symptom of Down’s Syndrome, hypopituitarism or a similar developmental defect.Is Delayed Tooth Eruption Harmful?Delayed tooth eruption that is not part of a broader problem isn’t a serious concern, but it may create a higher risk of dental problems later in life. In fact, a study of children who were genetically predisposed to late tooth eruption found their chances of needing orthodontic treatment by 30 years old was 35 percent higher. In addition, keep in mind primary teeth play an important role in helping kids eat well, and are a guide for permanent teeth to serve the same purpose.For most children with no teeth, a delay is simply an opportunity for parents to enjoy their gummy smile a little longer.Nonetheless, the parents should arrange a dental visit for children whose teeth appear later than the regular schedule – especially if they’re worried the delay may indicate a more serious issue. Caring for your child’s teeth, however late they erupt, gives them the best start for long-lasting oral health.https://dentalgist.ng/kids-with-no-teeth-what-causes-delays-in-tooth-eruption";" 46 ";"Dentalgist"

"4 Effective Weight Loss Exercises - Health - Nairaland";"markbor";"A lot of us live our lives like penned animals. Built to move, too often we put ourselves in a cage. We have bodies designed for racing across the savannas, but we live a lifestyle designed for migrating from the bed to the breakfast table; to the car seat; to the office chair; to the restaurant booth; to the living room couch and back to the bed.It was not always this way. Not long ago in the Nigeria, a man who worked on a farm did the equivalent of 15 miles of jogging every day; and his wife did the equivalent of 7 miles of jogging.Today, our daily obligations of work and home keep us tied to our chairs, and if we want exercise, we have to seek it out.In fact, health experts insist that obesity problem is probably caused at least as much by lack of physical activity as by eating too much. Hence, it is important that people need to move around.However, that does not mean that a lap or two around the old high school track will offset a daily dose of donuts. Exercise alone is not very efficient, experts say. They contend that if you just exercise and do not change your diet, you may be able to prevent weight gain or even lose a few kilos for a while. Nevertheless, it is not something that you are likely to sustain unless exercise is part of an overall program. The more regularly you exercise, the easier it is to maintain your weight. Here is what to do every day to make sure that you get the exercise you need.1. Get quality SleepMake sure that you get adequate sleep. Good sleep habits are conducive to exercise, experts point out. If you feel worn out during the day, you are less likely to get much physical activity during the day.In addition, there is evidence that people who are tired tend to eat more, using food as a substance for the rest they need.2. Walk the walk.It is probably the easiest exercise program of all. In fact, it may be all you ever have to do, according to some professional advices of some health experts.Gradually build up to at least 30 minutes of brisk walking five times a week. Brisk walks themselves have health and psychological benefits that are well worth the while.3. Walk the treadmill.When the weather is bad, you might not feel like going outdoors. But if you have a treadmill in the television room, you can catch up on your favorite shows while you are doing your daily good turn for your weight-maintenance plan.Most of us watch television anyway, and indoor exercise equipment enables anyone to turn a sedentary activity into a healthy walk.4. Seize the time.Excuses aside, lack of time is certainly a limiting factor in most lifestyles. That is why health experts suggest a basic guideline for incorporating exercise into your schedule.Get as much exercise as you can that feels good without letting it interfere with your work or family life. If you need to, remind yourself that you are preventing many health problems when you prevent weight gain; and keeping your health is a gift to your family as well as yourself.While The Diet Manual alone will produce truly amazing amounts of fat loss, The Workout Manual can help you to nearly double your results. Even if you don’t like to work out, We have developed an exercise program  that provides “no excuses” because they take just 20 minutes a day, 3-4 days per week.

"2019 Is One Of The Hottest In History, UN Agency Says - Health - Nairaland";"BrandSpurNG";"The year 2019 concludes a decade of exceptional global heat, retreating ice and record sea levels driven by greenhouse gases from human activities. Average temperatures for the five-year (2015-2019) and ten-year (2010-2019) periods are almost certain to be the highest on record. 2019 is on course to be the second or third warmest year on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.The WMO provisional Statement on the State of the Global Climate, says that the global average temperature in 2019 (January to October) was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period.Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a record level of 407.8 parts per million in 2018 and continued to rise in 2019. CO2 lasts in the atmosphere for centuries and the ocean for even longer, thus locking in climate change.Sea level rise has accelerated since the start of satellite measurements in 1993 because of the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, according to the report.The ocean, which acts as a buffer by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide, is paying a heavy price. Ocean heat is at record levels and there have been widespread marine heatwaves. Seawater is 26 percent more acidic than at the start of the industrial era. Vital marine ecosystems are being degraded.The daily Arctic sea-ice extent minimum in September 2019 was the second-lowest in the satellite record and October has seen further record low extents. In Antarctica, 2019 saw record low ice extents in some months.“If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3°C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “We are nowhere near on track to meet the Paris Agreement target.”“On a day-to-day basis, the impacts of climate change play out through extreme and “abnormal” weather. And, once again in 2019, weather and climate-related risks hit hard. Heatwaves and floods which used to be “once in a century” events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries ranging from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,” said Mr Taalas.“One of the main impacts of climate change is more erratic rainfall patterns. This poses a threat to crop yields and, combined with population increase, will mean considerable food security challenges for vulnerable countries in the future,” he said.The report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. This is based on input from a wide variety of United Nations partners (listed in notes to editors).Extreme heat conditions are taking an increasing toll on human health and health systems with greater impacts where there are aging populations, urbanization, urban heat island effects, and health inequities.  In 2018, a record 220 million more heatwave exposures by vulnerable persons over the age of 65 occurred, compared with the average for the baseline of 1986-2005.Climate variability and extreme weather events are among the key drivers of the recent rise in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe crises. After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million people suffered from hunger in 2018.  Among 33 countries affected by food crises in 2018, climate variability and weather extremes a compounding driver together with economic shocks and conflict in 26 countries and the leading driver in 12 of the 26.More than 10 million new internal displacements were recorded between January and June 2019, 7 million being triggered by hazard events such as Cyclone Idai in southeast Africa, Cyclone Fani in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia, generating acute humanitarian and protection needs.The provisional State of the Climate report provides an authoritative source of information for the U.N. climate change negotiations, known as CoP25, which take place in Madrid from 2 to 13 December. It complements the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The final Statement on the State of the Climate with complete 2019 data will be published in March 2020.Global Climate Indicators2019 ends the warmest decade on recordThe global mean temperature for the period January to October 2019 was 1.1 ± 0.1 °C above pre-industrial conditions (1850-1900). The five-year (2015-2019) and ten-year (2010-2019) averages are, respectively, almost certain to be the warmest five-year period and decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than the last.2019 is expected to be the second or third warmest year on record. 2016, which began with an exceptionally strong El Niño, remains the warmest year.Large areas of the Arctic were unusually warm in 2019. Most land areas were warmer than the recent average, including South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The U.S. state of Alaska was also exceptionally warm. In contrast, a large area of North America has been colder than the recent average.Record greenhouse gas concentrationsIn 2018, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs, with globally averaged mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) at 407.8±0.1 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4) at 1869±2 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 331.1±0.1 ppb.  These values constitute, respectively, 147%, 259% and 123% of pre-industrial 1750 levels.Global average figures for 2019 will not be available until late 2020, but real-time data from a number of specific locations indicate that CO2 levels continued to rise in 2019.Acceleration of global mean sea level riseSea level has increased throughout the satellite altimetry record, but the rate has increased over that time, due partly to the melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. In October 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value since the beginning of the high-precision altimetry record (January 1993).Ocean heatMore than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. In 2019, ocean heat content in the upper 700m (in a series starting in the 1950s) and upper 2000m (in a series starting in 2005) continued at record or near-record levels, with the average for the year so far exceeding the previous record highs set in 2018.Satellite retrievals of sea-surface temperature can be used to monitor marine heatwaves. So far in 2019, the ocean has on average experienced around 1.5 months of unusually warm temperatures. More of the ocean had a marine heatwave classified as “Strong” (38%) than “Moderate” (28%). In the north-east Pacific, large areas reached a marine heatwave category of “Severe”.Continued ocean acidificationIn the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 22% of the annual emissions of CO2, which helps to attenuate climate change. However, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations affect the chemistry of the ocean.Ocean observations have shown a decrease in the average global surface ocean pH at a rate of 0.017–0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s, as reported in the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which is equivalent to an increase in acidity of 26% since the beginning of the industrial revolution.Decline of sea iceThe continued long term decline of Arctic Sea Ice was confirmed in 2019. The September monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second-lowestUntil 2016, Antarctic sea ice extent had shown a small long-term increase. In late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in the extent to extreme values. Since then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.Greenland ice sheetTotal ice Mass Balance (TMB) for the Greenland Ice Sheet gives a net ice loss for September 2018 to August 2019 of 329 Gigatonnes (GT). To put this into context, data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites tell us that Greenland lost about 260 Gt of ice per year over the period 2002-2016, with a maximum of 458 Gt in 2011/12.High impact eventsFloodsThe Central USA, Northern Canada, Northern Russia and Southwest Asia received abnormally high precipitation. The 12-month rainfall averaged over the contiguous United States for the period for July 2018 to June 2019 (962 mm) was the highest on record.The onset and withdrawal of the Indian Monsoon were delayed, causing a large precipitation deficit in June but an excess of precipitation in the following months.Very wet conditions affected parts of South America in January. There was major flooding in northern Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay estimated at US$2.5 billion.The Islamic Republic of Iran was badly affected by flooding in late March and early April. Major flooding affected many hitherto drought-affected parts of east Africa in October and early November.DroughtDrought affected many parts of southeast Asia and the southwest Pacific in 2019, associated in many cases with the strongly positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. Exceptionally dry conditions prevailed from mid-year onwards in Indonesia and neighbouring countries, as well as parts of the Mekong basin further north. Long-term drought conditions which had affected many parts of inland eastern Australia in 2017 and 2018 expanded and intensified in 2019. Averaged over Australia as a whole, January-October was the driest since 1902.Dry conditions affected many parts of Central America. It was substantially drier than normal in Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador until heavy rains in October. Central Chile also had an exceptionally dry year, with rainfall for the year to 20 November at Santiago only 82 mm, less than 25% of the long-term average.HeatwavesTwo major heatwaves occurred in Europe in late June and late July. In France, a national record of 46.0°C (1.9°C above the previous record) was set on 28 June. National records were also set in Germany (42.6°C), the Netherlands (40.7°C), Belgium (41.8°C), Luxembourg (40.8°C) and the United Kingdom (38.7°C), with the heat also extending into the Nordic countries, where Helsinki had its highest temperature on record (33.2°C on 28 July).Australia had an exceptionally hot summer. The mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost 1°C, and January was Australia’s hottest month on record. The heat was most notable for its persistence but there were also significant individual extremes, including 46.6°C at Adelaide on 24 January, the city’s highest temperature on recordWildfiresIt was an above-average fire year in several high-latitude regions, including Siberia (Russian Federation) and Alaska (US), with fire activity occurring in some parts of the Arctic where it was previously extremely rare.The severe drought in Indonesia and neighbouring countries led to the most significant fire season since 2015. The number of reported fires in Brazil’s Amazonia region was only slightly above the 10-year average, but total fire activity in South America was the highest since 2010, with Bolivia and Venezuela among the countries with particularly active fire years.Tropical cyclonesTropical cyclone activity globally in 2019 was slightly above average. The Northern Hemisphere, to date, has had 66 tropical cyclones, compared with the average at this time of year of 56, although accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) was only 2% above average. The 2018-19 Southern Hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones.Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March as one of the strongest known on the east coast of Africa, resulting in many casualties and widespread devastation. Idai contributed to the complete destruction of close to 780 000 ha of crops in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region. The cyclone also resulted in at least 50 905 displaced persons in Zimbabwe, 53 237 in southern Malawi and 77 019 in Mozambique.One of the year’s most intense tropical cyclones was Dorian, which made landfall with category 5 intensity in the Bahamas. The destruction was worsened as it was exceptionally slow-moving and remained near-stationary for about 24 hours.Typhoon Hagibis made landfall west of Tokyo on 12 October, causing severe flooding.Climate-related risks and impactsHealth at increasing risk (World Health Organization)In 2019, record-setting high temperatures from Australia, India, Japan, and Europe impacted health and well-being. In Japan, a major heatwave event affected the country in late July to early August 2019 resulting in over 100 deaths and an additional 18 000 hospitalizations. Europe experienced two significant heat waves in the summer of 2019. In June, a heatwave affecting southwestern to central Europe resulted in a number of deaths in Spain and France. The most significant heatwave was in late July, affecting much of central and western Europe. In the Netherlands, the heatwave was associated with 2 964 deaths, nearly 400 more deaths than during an average summer weekChanges in climatic conditions since 1950 are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito species to transmit dengue virus, increasing the risk of the occurrence of disease. In parallel, the global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades, and about half of the world population is now at risk of infection. In 2019, the world has experienced a large increase in dengue cases, compared with the same time period in 2018.Food security continues to be negatively affected (Food and Agriculture Organization)In Southern Africa, the start of the seasonal rains was delayed and there were extensive dry periods. Regional cereal output is forecasted to be about 8 per cent below the five-year average with 12.5 million people in the region expected to experience severe food insecurity up to March 2020, an increase of more than 10 per cent from the previous year.Food security has been deteriorating in several areas of Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda due to a poor long/Gu rainy season. Overall, about 12.3 million people are food insecure in the Horn of Africa region. Between October and November 2019, Somalia was further affected by intense flooding.Associated with the worst flooding in a decade affecting some parts of Afghanistan in March 2019, 13.5 million people are food insecure in the country, with 22 out of 34 provinces still recovering from severe drought conditions faced in 2018.Disasters increase population displacement (UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration)More than 10 million new internal displacements were recorded between January and June 2019, 7 million being triggered by disasters such as Cyclone Idai in Southeast Africa, Cyclone Fani in South Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia, associated with acute humanitarian and protection needs.Floods were the most commonly cited natural hazard contributing to displacement, followed by storms and droughts. Asia and the Pacific remain the world’s most disaster displacement-prone region due to both sudden and slow-onset disasters.The number of new displacements associated with weather extremes could more than triple to around 22 million by the end of 2019.SOURCE:https://brandspurng.com/2019/12/03/2019-is-one-of-the-hottest-in-history-un-agency-says/";" 53 ";"BrandSpurNG"

"World AIDS Day: Despite Efforts, Challenges Still Persist - Health - Nairaland";"JosEast";"Since the first two cases of AIDS, which sent panic, doubt and disbelief to the nation, was diagnosed in Nigeria in 1985 and reported in 1986 in Lagos, the fight by both the Federal Government and donor agencies to bring an end to the epidemic has been intensified, but achievement is still dragging in some aspect. Thirty years after, challenges such as stigmatization, lack of fund, access to drugs and others have not been fully tackled.  The spread of the infection over the past years has a great impact on health, welfare, employment and the criminal justice sectors; affecting all social and ethnic groups throughout the world, as the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s recent epidemiological data indicate that HIV remains a public health issue that persistently drains our economic sector having claimed more than 25 million lives over the last three decades.  The 2019 Nigerian HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS) result released early in the year by the Federal Government of Nigeria indicate a national HIV prevalence in Nigeria of 1.4% among adults aged 15–49 years. Previous estimates had indicated a national HIV prevalence of 2.8%. UNAIDS and the National Agency for the Control of AIDS estimate that there are 1.9 million people living with HIV in Nigeria. President Muhammadu Buhari, while speaking at the launch of the report, said Nigeria welcomed the news that there are fewer people living with HIV in the country than previously estimated and launched the Revised National HIV and AIDS Strategic Framework 2019–2021, which will guide the country’s future response to the epidemic. “Nigeria has made good progress in scaling up HIV treatment and prevention services in recent years. “For the first time, the end of AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 is truly in sight for our country. I urge all of us not to relent but to increase the momentum. Let us work collectively and push for the last mile.” Prevalence rate HIV/AIDS prevalence rate differ from state to state in Nigeria. NAIIS report for 2019 revealed that two South-south states are among the three states with the highest HIV prevalence rate in Nigeria as Akwa Ibom tops the chart with about 5.5 per cent of its residents living with the virus, followed by Benue which has a prevalence rate of 5.3 percent while Rivers is third with a prevalence rate of 3.8 per cent. The result shows that about one percent of Nigerians (1.9 million people) are currently living with HIV/AIDS. This figure moves Nigeria from second to the fourth position among countries battling the HIV epidemic. With an earlier estimate of about 3.2 million people living with HIV, Nigeria was second after South Africa which ranks first with about 7.1 million people living with HIV. Patients challenges Though many enlightened Nigerians have started seeing the ailment as other sicknesses but challenges of stigmatisation from family members, work places and from the public is still on the high side, thereby making many that are living with the virus to keep mute over their status. Access to drugs in some facilities is still a challenge also. Some members of Adolescent and Young People Living with HIV (AYP) in Benue State have identified user fees, non-disclosure of status and stigma as key factors militating against the ability of sufferers to access drugs. At least three of them who didn’t want their names on print spoke to our correspondent in Makurdi. One of them said user fees in some health facilities such as the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) in Makurdi where a sufferer is required to pay N200 have made it difficult for the unemployed to access their ARV drugs regularly. “The ARV drugs are provided for people supposedly at an absolutely free rate but when sufferers proceed to adult session or the clinic to access their drugs, some of them are turned back due to lack of money. “At the FMC, the fee charged is N200 but unemployed young people don’t have such money all the time so they are turned back without accessing their drug. This means that their viral load would increase which may now lead to other opportunistic infection,” the respondent said. He added that the issue of disclosure was also a factor, stressing that a positive person would only do well in health when he or she summons courage to disclose their status while opining that parents owe it a duty to tell their positive children why they are placed on drugs. For this respondent, stigmatisation makes it difficult for positive people to disclose their status and until that matter is taken seriously by those concerned, many would continue to die silently. Another respondent, who said he accesses drugs alongside his wife free of any charges at the FSP HIV facility in Agan-Makurdi, agreed that stigmatisation remains a big issue. The respondent said apart from his immediate family and health workers who know about his positive status, he had refused to disclose his status to his friends and colleagues. Similarly, a teenage girl, who claimed to access her drugs freely at Gbajimgba General Hospital, expressed worry that stigma has restrained many people from accessing drugs at various facilities. Agency and donor’s efforts The Director-General National Agency for the Control of AIDS, Dr Gambo Aliyu, at a press briefing to commemorate the 2019 World AIDS Day with the theme, ‘Communities Make the Difference’, said Nigeria accounts for more than half of new infections and deaths from AIDS-related illnesses. According to him, less than 40 percent of Nigerian adolescents and young people have the appropriate knowledge and comprehensive knowledge about HIV. Dr Aliyu decried the decline in international and domestic funding for the control of HIV/AIDS in the country. “We still have work to do. As Nigeria strives to achieve epidemic control in an environment where international funding for HIV is reducing and Nigeria’s domestic funding for HIV is estimated to be below 30 percent, the efforts of communities are urgently needed to ensure that HIV remains on the political agenda and galvanize international and national funding for HIV,” he said. Chairman, House Committee on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Control, Dahiru Sariki, said health workers would soon begin a house-to-house HIV/AIDS screening in communities across Nigeria. He said the screening would ensure that a good number of Nigerians ascertain their HIV status and push for early treatment and prevention. He urged the NACA to ensure more Nigerians are captured in the screening process with a view to achieving the goal of making the nation HIV-free. New campaign against HIV/AIDS In commemoration of the 2019 WAD, the Federal Government in conjunction with NACA and PEPFAR launched the ‘Undetectable=Untransmittable’ (“U=U”) campaign to promote the benefit of treatment to people living with HIV/AIDS and encourage HIV positive persons to access treatment. Launching the campaign on Monday, the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, said the campaign will help the country achieve zero new HIV infections and reduce stigma for Nigerians living with HIV. “With the unveiling of this campaign, we are joining the rest of the international community to raise the consciousness of all Nigerians to the fact that Undetectable viral load equals to Untransmittable virus. With the unveiling of this campaign, we stand with Nigerians living with HIV to support their goal of viral load suppression,” he said. Also speaking at the launch, the DG of NACA, Dr Aliyu, said this year’s WAD theme acknowledged the essential role communities play in the global HIV response. “Communities include; networks of people living with or are affected by HIV, women and young people, peer educators, counsellors, community health workers, door-to-door service providers, civil society organizations, media, religious leaders, traditional rulers, policy makers, implementing partners and activists.” He stated that achieving epidemic control will require more resources in the form of community time and effort to educate the society, fight stigma and discrimination, and improve access to HIV services by every member of the community. He added that Nigeria needs to ensure her programmes for prevention, treatment and care are community compliant, targeted, cost efficient and sustainable. “This is possible with meaningful community engagement in planning, budgeting and implementation of our intervention programs. The U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief Mission, Ms Kathleen FitzGibbon, noted that for the first time in modern history, they have the opportunity to control the AIDS epidemic in Nigeria, adding that “U=U” has proven to change the way people view HIV and HIV-positive individuals. “It empowers patients to not only get tested but to take control of their status, with the ultimate goal of maintaining an undetectable viral load. “With the great partnership we share with the government of Nigeria, I’m sure we can achieve HIV epidemic control in Nigeria,” she said.

The study found statistically significant broad spectrum antibiotic effects without any of the resistance of common antibiotics.Antifungal effectsSeveral fungi, yeasts, and protozoa are reported to be inactivated or killed by monolaurin, including some species of ringworm and candida albicans. Candida albicans is a common fungal pathogen that lives in the gut, mouth, genitals, urinary tract, and skin. It can be life-threatening in immunocompromised people.A recent study found that monolaurin has potential as an antifungal treatment for candida albicans — one that can also reduce a pro-inflammatory response.Antiviral effectsIt’s reported that some of the viruses that have been inactivated, at least partially, by monolaurin include:HIVmeaslesherpes simplex-1vesicular stomatitisvisna viruscytomegalovirusA 2015 study published in PLOS ONE tested a monolaurin vaginal gel in female primates.

"7 Health Hacks That Will Change Your Life - Health - Nairaland";"jameshood";"Heath trends are a dime a dozen these days. It seems like every week there’s a new superfood discovered or another exotic berry being touted as the ultimate all-in-one-cure-for-everything. The truth remains that our health is a profoundly diverse topic and there is no “one size fits all” approach. For example, can you imagine trying to convince people from remote hunter-gatherer regions that they should be vegan? What would they do; plant a kale patch in the middle of the tundra? Despite our bio-individuality, there are some scientifically proven ways to increase overall quality of life without breaking the bank or diving too deeply into the confusing world of health fads.1. Eat The RainbowThe most obvious way to “hack” your health is to eat well. Most of us have fairly good access to a wide range of fruits and vegetables, so a great way to ensure that you’re consuming a multitude of nutritional goodness is to include foods of all different colors in your diet. Here’s a general guide to the most common benefits associated with each food color group!2. H.I.I.T. (High-Intensity Interval Training)A 2011 study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology indicated that decreasing workout time, but increasing the intensity of each exercise, yielded positive results when compared to longer periods of low-intensity workouts. This method is known as high-intensity interval training (H.I.I.T.). Evidence from the Norwegian HUNT study also found that just a single weekly session of high-intensity training was proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in both men and women.3. Techno-FastCan you recall the last time you went a full 24 hours without using your phone, tablet, computer, television or radio? For most people, 24 hours without personal gadgets and gizmos would be a tough burden to bear! Granted, it’s impractical to not have access to these things on a daily basis, however, limiting your use of tech, especially at night, can have huge benefits on your health!The National Sleep Foundationclaims that there is strong scientific data documenting the role of light-emitting “devices” in promoting wakefulness. Photoreceptors in our eyes sense light and dark, indicating to our brains the status of the world around us and regulating our circadian rhythms based on the natural day-night cycle. This reception of light and dark allows us to be alert in the morning and sleepy at night. The same functional considerations apply to the light emitted from our computers, tablets and smartphones. Even our smallest electronic devices can emit an adequate amount of light to confuse the brain and increase wakefulness.Try to set aside at least one hour before going to bed during which time you stop using any light emitting devices. It’s likely that you will have a more restful sleep with noticeable flow-on benefits for your health.4. Get Into NatureEven if you’re not the jump-in-a-muddy-puddle type, assimilation with nature can be instrumental in improving your overall wellbeing. A series of studies published in the Journal of Environmental Philosophy found that mental fatigue can be combated by immersing oneself in restorative environments; such as the “great outdoors”. One study even discovered that people’s mental energy increased simply by looking at pictures of nature – incidentally, pictures of cityscapes didn’t produce the same effect.Another professed benefit of connection with nature can be found in the ancient practice of “earthing” or “grounding”. This tradition involves simply placing your bare feet firmly on the earth (grass or dirt) for a prolonged period of time and “absorbing” Earth’s natural electrical energy. Dr Sinatra from Heart MD Institute wrote a book detailing this topic called “Earthing”, which you can find here.5. Water: Quality & QuantityThe health benefits of water have been well documented across all cultures throughout history, after all, it is essential to our survival! The human body is comprised of about 65% water, which we require for many significant processes, including blood circulation, metabolism, regulation of body temperature and waste removal/detoxification. The commonly accepted recommendation is that adults should drink roughly 2 liters of water per day to support good health, however, the quality of water we drink is an important factor also. Both chlorine and fluoride, which are commonly found in many public water supplies, have been linked to increased rates of cancer.If you can’t control the purity of water that you have access to you, it’s a good idea to install a high-quality filter. If you’re unsure of your water quality, just do a quick google search for “water quality home testing kit” and test your own!6. Ice Baths (Or Cold Showers)We’ve all experienced that unpleasant scenario: the hot water cuts out mid-shower and you’re rudely jolted out of your blissfully warm, meditative state. Interestingly though, some people believe that practices such as ice baths and cold showers can actually have very positive effects on your health. Benefits include increased alertness, deep breathing, improved circulation and decreased levels of stress. Sounds good, right?!If you’re a little nervous about the whole idea of an “ice bath”, just start by enjoying a regular shower, then turn the hot water off for 1 minute before you get out. You’ll notice the effect on your breathing and mental state immediately.7. The Science of SmilingThis one is almost self-explanatory. Wise men and women through all ages have claimed that the simple act of smiling can transform you and the world around you. Common sense and natural instincts indicate that smiles are contagious and that they make us appear more attractive to others. Some studieshave even linked this humble muscle adjustment to increased lifespan – that’s a pretty good reason to put a smile on your dial!.Do You Have A Favorite Health Hack?

"4 Tips To Control Your Premature Ejaculation - Health - Nairaland";"markbor";"According to the Mayo clinic, the ""time limit"" associated with premature ejaculation is one minute (or less) after penetration. Various studies have attempted to determine what the average amount of time between vaginal entrance and ejaculation is for a man. One study found that 5.4 minutes was the norm; another determined it was 7 minutes.However, for many men (and couples), premature ejaculation is not based on one specific set time; rather, it is defined as a man ejaculating at any time prior to his partner achieving satisfaction. Under this definition, it's possible for a man to vigorously engage in sex for, say, an hour and still ejaculate ""prematurely"" if his partner remains unsatisfied.While there is no guarantee that a man can alter the speed of ejaculation, there are some exercises in which many men engage which are associated with enhanced ejaculatory control.1. Kegels. Performing kegel exercises is recommended by many not just for ejaculatory control but also for general joystick health. The pubococcygeus muscle extends along the pelvic ""floor,"" from the pubic bone to the tailbone. If a man is urinating and needs to stop before he is finished, he naturally tightens the pubococcygeus in order to cut off urinal flow. Contracting and releasing this muscle is calling performing a ""kegel."" Doing two or three sets of 10 kegels every day is thought to give a man greater control during sex.2. Edging while masturbating. Many men also recommend ""edging"" as a way of gaining control over the ejaculation. Edging simply means masturbating to the point where a man almost ejaculates, stopping, and then resuming masturbation again until the same thing happens a second time, and repeating this for as long as possible. Some men can edge for an hour or more while masturbating and report that this helps them extend themselves during sex.3. Edging during intercourse. Also called ""stop and start,"" this is essentially employing edging while having partner sex. The man thrusts until he is nearing ejaculation, then withdraws, waits a few moments, and begins thrusting again.4. Squeezing. As a variation on edging during intercourse, the male withdraws as ejaculation draws closer and squeezes the base of the joystick very tightly until the desire to ejaculate diminishes. He then resumes thrusting. Some men find this more effective than simple edging.This is only to get you started, for ADVANCED “Natural” Techniques to permanently cure your premature ejaculation & maintain hard erection once and for all, email irabormark@gmail.com  to download the Free report  titled “Natural Cure for Premature Ejaculation & Ed.

The special anatomical structure of the prostate and the pathological characteristics of chronic prostatitis make its treatment extremely difficult.

Our bodies water (blood vessels and urine) is going to be focused, which is not only prone to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, urinary calculus but also vulnerable to harm to the organs as a result of concentrated urine and lowered urination, which will problems the prostate and trigger prostatitis.Prostatitis is mainly split into acute prostatitis and chronic prostatitis, in which the hurt of chronic prostatitis is higher, simply because within the patients with prostatitis, the concealed mother nature from the condition is more robust, and the possibility of developing into worse prostatitis is greater.Consequently, in the absence of cardiovascular disease and kidney illness, guys should build the habit of typical drinking water supplement, drink 1500-2000 ml of boiled water or tea every single day, so as to fully flush the urethra through urine, which is conducive to the discharge of prostate secretion and may make sure the security of prostate.Even for individuals with prostatitis that have frequent urination signs, they should drink a lot more water.

"10 Foods For Harder Erections:  Natural Viagra Foods - Health - Nairaland";"markbor";"Being able to get a rock hard erection is the dream of many men, especially men in their 40s and 50s. Most men do fine when it comes to having a good erection but sometimes things don’t go so well down there.Sometimes you want to last just that little longer in bed and wish to have a long, sustained erection. If you’re struggling with getting or sustaining an erection then this article is all you need as it explains the science behind erection, foods for harder erections and some general tips as well.If you don’t really want to use supplements or drugs for achieving solid healthy erections, then try some natural Viagra foods that are scientifically proven to help your erections. So here they are:1. PomegranatesPomegranates have many benefits for men who want to achieve harder erections. Researchers from around the world are intrigued with the miraculous healing powers of this fruit.The thing that makes pomegranates a beneficial food for erections is its influence on testosterone production.  In addition, it also increases the nitric oxide production in the body and protects NO from other free radicals.2. SpinachSpinach truly is one of the best foods for harder erections for many reasons. Spinach has natural nitrates that convert into nitric oxide by the actions of the tongue and gut bacteria and nitric oxide is very important when it comes to erections. You can call spinach a natural steroid food because it is quite rich in phytoecdysteroids, like ecdysterone, which is beneficial for testosterone production.Spinach is also high in ecdysterone that in one study gave better results than anabolic steroids. All the ecdysterone gathered into the body supports natural testosterone production and helps men achieve harder erections. Spinach also has a rich number of vitamins and minerals needed for nitric oxide and testosterone production.3. BeetsBeets happen to be great for the heart, due to the fact they contain a massive amount of nitrates, which are compounds in the body that transform into nitric oxide.The more nitrates you consume through food, the higher the nitric oxide that is released into your circulation, and thankfully, beets contain considerable amounts of nitrates. This is the reason that beets are one of the best foods for harder erections.4. PorridgeA healthy diet and active lifestyle are the building blocks for great sex. Oats are good for you because they are good for your heart health, fill your belly and make you more energetic in bed.They are packed full of soluble fiber that will help to clear cholesterol leaving blood vessels smooth and healthy, allowing blood to flow easily. Porridge comes under the list of top foods for achieving harder erections.5. GarlicIt may make your breath stink a bit but it is an incredible sex food for men. Garlic functions as a nitric oxide booster and a potent NOS activator, which in turn increases blood flow to the penis leading to harder erections.Incorporating garlic in your diet has also been proven in human beings to be more powerful at decreasing blood pressure as compared to the majority of pharmaceutical options.And as you can imagine this is beneficial for harder erections, because high blood pressure can be one of the root causes of Erectile dysfunction.6. SaffronSaffron helps in healing the aches and pains of your body. It can make the body more sensitive to touch and feelings. This is also helpful in increasing the libido in men and women.Though a bit expensive, it is quite beneficial for erections and you should consider consuming it on a daily basis.7. Whole GrainsIt is easier to have a harder and powerful erection if you consume more good carbs. But understand that there are good carbs and bad carbs.The kind of carbs you get from sweets, candies etc. are bad for health and you don’t need them.But, the kinds you get from whole grains are good for your health and testosterone production too.8. BananasPeople with harder erections have healthier hearts. So you should eat bananas to get the potassium in the body which is a great way to improve heart health and blood circulation.Eating enough potassium will modulate sodium levels and stop them becoming too high and this, in turn, reduces the risks of heart problems.9. WineYou might be surprised to hear this but the truth is that wine helps in getting a harder erection. It is a great source of the antioxidant phytochemical resveratrol which opens the arteries by enhancing the production of nitric oxide.Nitric oxide expands the blood vessels and this is how Viagra works. But the key here is moderation. Wine, especially the red wine, when taken in moderation causes harder erections. Excess wine, however, will actually cause a decline in erection strength.10. WalnutsWalnuts are another one of the powerful foods for erections because they are incredibly high in arginine which will convert to Nitric Oxide which is crucial for strong erections.Other nuts also contain arginine but walnuts are the king when it comes to boosting the strength of erections.Another great way to improve erections is to do some exercises that work the stomach area as the increased blood flow to this area which is close to the penis will improve erections considerably.It is time that sex became satisfying for you. It is time that you could actually stay longer in your bedroom to get exactly what you desire and need from getting close with the woman that you love the most without having to depend on drugs or pills.For ADVANCED “Natural” Techniques to permanently cure your premature ejaculation and Ed once and for all, Call/Whatsapp 08023342859 or email irabormark@gmail.com  to download a Free report  titled “Natural Cure For Premature Ejaculation & Ed” Is this MONSTER Affecting your marriage?

"Is Sleeping Next To A Fridge Dangerous? - Health - Nairaland";"Kiddo01";"If you are wondering if it’s dangerous to sleep next to a fridge, I can help you. I’ve been sleeping next to one in a small student’s dorm for 3 years now. It’s basically just a 2-second walk from my bed to the fridge. Are fridges dangerous to sleep next to because of their radiation and noise? How does it affect your sleep? And how can you manage to sleep next to a fridge without worrying from now on? Let’s find out!                          Basically, sleeping next to a fridge is not dangerous at all. I mean, the fridge won’t punch you at night. However, it is kind of “passive dangerous”. The noise of a fridge definitely has an impact on your sleep quality.Also, fridges heat up the room they’re in by a few degrees. And even a few degrees temperature change have an impact on our biological functions. Just like scientists are panicking about a few degrees temperature rise in the next years. Only one or two degrees rise in average temperature makes the north pole melt. The same applies to your room. Little temperature changes can have a big impact on you. And on top of that, fridges radiate (this is the point where some people freak out). But luckily, the radiation is not significant enough to have an impact on you.The best thing you can do about it is to protect yourself against the noise using earplugs. The second best thing (but just a short-term solution) is to change the temperature settings temporarily, so your fridge stays quiet while you try to fall asleep.Also, white noise machines are an awesome tool to use when you want to protect yourself against fridge noise";" 72 ";"Kiddo01"

"How To Overcome Depression Permanently. - Health - Nairaland";"PastorDavidAwuj";"HOW TO OVERCOME DEPRESSION.The dictionary meaning of depression says it is a feeling of utter hopelessness.  despondency, self-disgust and loss of perspective!It is a mood swing into which a man is cast.Who is the author? - Satan, the enemy!Depression chokes the brain! It robs and blinds the mind.Luke  8:14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.2 Corinthians  4:4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.It is a very destructive weapon of the enemy. It must be fought! It is a destroyer! It makes victims of men.It enters into the mind to block it from the light of the glorious gospel. It chokes the Word and makes the mind unproductive.When you are depressed, your access to God’s presence is blocked Psalms  100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.Depression disconnects you from the Father. Depression destroys your harvest. If the devil can get you depressed any day, he has spoilt your day.Depression brings a man under a curse Deuteronomy  28:47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;  28:48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in unclothedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.It is the worst enemy of your destiny.Depression retards your flight to your high places, as your joy is cut off.Habakkuk  3:17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:  3:18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.  3:19 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.Satan brings cares, worries and anxieties to keep you down, the Word of God becomes meaningless to you and consequently unimportant.Move away from any depressed person! He can depress your life! Depression can destroy your health Proverbs  17:22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.It is destructive to your health, which Satan wants destroyed.The moment you subscribe to depression, the things that should be working start failing. Whereas sins are forgivable, depression has to be treated, because it is a sin against oneself, not against God. So deal with it!Rejoice Evermore!Joy is the secret of our superiority over Satan. Depression makes victims of men, but joy makes champions of men.Philippians  4:4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.Joy is a pace-setter in our Christian race. The more of it you have, the more victories you enjoy over Satan. The only medicine for depression is joy! Joy is the only way to ventilate your spirit. James  5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.When you’re depressed you have no contact with God’s presence. A ‘praisefull’ life is what is required to carry God’s presence. Without joy, you have no access to revelations.Isaiah  12:3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.And without revelation, there’s no faith and without faith, there is no victory 1 John  5:4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.Joy makes your day!Serve the Lord with joyfulness and gladness of heart and Satan will have no access to you. Satan is out to move you against God. Keep him off with joy - singing and making melody in your heart unto the Lord Ephesians  5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;Organise for joy and happiness Programme for it. Fill your house with music. Live in constant gratitude and thankfulness to God.To take God for granted is to be grounded! Let your heart dwell in a ceaseless flow of thanksgiving and appreciation unto God. To be ""praise-full"" is to be ""win-full"".There is nothing in this world that should be allowed to destroy your eternity. People who are cheaply moved never live to move their mountains.The level of joy you operate determines the level of exploits you enjoy. It makes you and God an informidable, invincible team, and establishes your triumph over Satan in any conflict of life.Heaviness is a spirit.Isaiah  61:3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.It is one of the key strategies of Satan to strip God’s people naked. Satan calculates heaviness for God’s people because he knows no one can stop the fiery acts of God when man is giving God quality praise. So fight heaviness!Every time you can’t find joy, the thief is at work. The devil comes to steal your joy so he can make a victim of you. But a ceaseless flow of joy will cause your spiritual life to blossom. Engage in this ""heavenly sense"" to be free from depression.Flee from covetousness! For a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he has.Luke  12:15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.Serving God is unprofitable when it’s not done joyfully and gladly. A joyful track in your walk with God is the anointing for harvest.Rejoice in the Lord always, not in the things you have! Until you count all things but dung, your joy in the Lord will not be genuine.It takes joy to operate in the excellent spirit that makes for distinction. It takes joy to create a future. You belong to the order of joy by creation.Galatians  5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith.So let the fruit flow!Friend, our minds play a very great part in what becomes of our lives and future. So bring your mind into subjection to the Word of God. Know also that as much as your mind is the battle-field, it is also the victory ground. It is where your destiny is determined.What you think makes your tomorrow. What you think determines the things you say and what you say is what shapes your life. God is listening to what is going on inside you more than what you are saying with your mouth.Guard your mind with all watchfulness.2 Corinthians  10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.God is still on the throne!Rejoice.Excerpts from, Satan get lost by David Oyedepo.";" 421 ";"PastorDavidAwuj"

"5 Ways To Enhance Your Memory - Health - Nairaland";"hbatagarawa";"“Right now,” said Steven Wright, “I’m having amnesia and deja vu at the same time. I think I’ve forgotten this before.” And while it’s true that youngsters do forget names, math facts, and when Dad said to be home, many folks 50 and older notice that their recall (what year did we go to California?) isn’t what it used to be.When you have such a senior moment, it’s just a stutter in what’s called episodic memory, and rarely is it long-lasting. But if you’re concerned about your recall, talk to your doc about stress, sleep problems, depression, thyroid disease, diabetes, vitamin B-12 deficiency, excess alcohol use, infections, and your medications. They’re all possible memory-busters. And try our unforgettable, brain-boosting tips!Walk fast for at least 30 minutes daily, heading for 10,000 steps a day. Any exercise, but especially aerobics that make you sweat, is the very best memory enhancer.Cut body-wide inflammation with omega-3 DHA from salmon or ocean trout; and take 900 mg of DHA from algal oil daily. Add in more omega-3s: walnuts, canola, and extra-virgin olive oil.Try the spice turmeric to reduce triglyceride levels, increase fat burning, and keep blood sugar steady. Dr. Mike carries packets of yellow mustard, full of turmeric, to add to snacks and meals.Take two baby aspirins daily (if your doc approves) with a half-glass of water before and after.Get romantic. The neurotransmitter dopamine helps control information flow and memory. Levels decrease with age, but zoom up with sexual activity.If you’ve hit mid-life, you’ve probably noticed signs of aging — wrinkles, thinning hair, and maybe a few extra pounds around your hips or belly.And while that creeping middle-aged weight gain may not be desirable . . .There’s one area of your body you should keep as plump and fat as possible — and that’s your brain. You see, your brain shrinks by about 5% per decade after you hit age 40.  Maybe that doesn’t sound like much to you, but listen . . Your brain contains about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons.Each piece of your brain the size of a speck of sand contains 100,000 neurons all trying to talk to each other through 1 billion connecting points called synapses.This allows over 100,000 chemical reactions to occur in your brain every second. Crucial chemicals called neurotransmitters move across connection points and release their contents into gaps between these synapses.And all these connections going on inside your brain are what allow you to create and retain memories, form ideas and thoughts, experience emotions, and even express your unique personality.Why You Want a Fat BrainYour brain only weighs about 3 pounds. Yet about 60% of your brain is fat. This makes your brain the fattest organ you have.  And this fat is essential for your brain to function.  For one thing, your brain requires fat for energy. Although your brain makes up only about 2% of your body weight, it uses a whopping 20% of the energy your body produces just to function normally.Fat is necessary to create brain cell membranes and produce neurotransmitters. Plus, it serves as the raw material to make hormones.And fat makes up about 60% to 80% of the myelin sheath, a protective covering around nerve axons. These axons represent the primary transmission lines of your nervous system.As you can see, the fat in your brain serves many vital functions.Shrinkage Matters to Your Memory — Especially if You’re a WomanTwo areas of your brain especially prone to age-related shrinkage are the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. These are important parts of the brain when it comes to memory, learning, and other complex mental activities.With aging, neurons themselves shrink in number and volume. The connections between nerve cells deteriorate and become less extensive. The level of neurotransmitters declines.And a shrinking brain is only one of the changes your brain faces as the years pass.  With aging, the brain undergoes a gradual reduction in blood flow.  Aging speeds up an imbalanced process of inflammation in the brain (as well as the entire body).  Free radicals in the brain and body accumulate at a faster rate with age. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can damage neurons and other cells throughout the body.Scientists have found that women suffer more age-related shrinkage in areas of the brain related to memory than men do. And while men are not exempt from those frustrating “senior moments,” their brain shrinkage tends to cause more changes in areas related to thinking and feeling.So what does all this mean?Well, by the time you hit mid-life, when it comes to brain health, you’re no longer on the offense.After 40, You Need to Play aYou may have noticed that you tend to forget where you put things — like your car keys. Or your phone. Or your glasses, even when they’re sitting on top of your head.  Or you might forget appointments or names of people you’ve just met.You might have more difficulty concentrating or focusing on tasks than you used to. Or perhaps you have a foggy brain feeling that keeps you from thinking clearly.  You see, aging is the single greatest risk factor for developing memory concerns.And over 60% of people middle-aged and older suffer some degree of memory impairment.  In fact, according to the National Institute on Aging, memory problems are one of the first warning signs of cognitive loss, which involves mental slowing and declining intellect.Fortunately, while you can’t stop the inevitable march of time . . .You can take some simple steps to combat brain shrinkage and other signs of aging that could impact your memory — and your quality of life.Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Mike Roizen, Newsmax Healthhttp://www.mediaissuesng.com/health/5-ways-to-enhance-your-memory/";" 113 ";"hbatagarawa"
"Good News! Hemorrhoids Of Longer Years Can be Gotten rid of Naturally.. - Health - Nairaland";"jaregold";"Hemorrhoids are swollen and inflamed veins in the rectum or anus. They can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).   Swollen hemorrhoids are also known as piles and are of course the most common causes of rectal bleeding.  Internal hemorrhoids are far inside the rectum that you can't usually see or feel them, they don't generally hurt because you have few pain-sensing nerves there. Bleeding may be the only sign of them.   Internal haemorrhoids can be further graded according to whether they are in the anus or have fallen out (prolapsed).Grade I – Completely internal, do not fall out (no prolapse)Grade II – Fall out (prolapse) on straining but go back in by itself.Grade III – Fall out (prolapse) on straining and stay out, and only go back if pushed back.Grade IV – Fall out (prolapse), and will not push back in. May be very painful due to strangulation  External hemorrhoids are under the skin around the anus, where they are many more pain-sensing nerves, so they tend to hurt as well as bleed. Sometimes hemorrhoids prolapse or get bigger and bulge outside the anal sphincter that you may be able to see them as moist bumps that are pinker than the surrounding area. And they are more likely to hurt, often when you poop.  Prolapsed hemorrhoids usually go back inside on their own. Even if they don't, they can often be gently pushed back into the place.   According to American Society Of Colon And Rectal Surgeons, around 5% of people with hemorrhoids experience symptoms such as pains, discomfort and bleeding. Other symptoms may include;• swelling around the anus• one or more lumps near the anus which might be tender or painful.• bright red blood on your stools, toilet paper or in the toilet bowl.• pains during bowel movement• itching or irritation around the anal region, etc       Increase in pressure in the lower rectum could cause the blood vessels in the lower rectum to become swollen and inflamed.  The following factors can increase pressure within the lower rectum and hence may increase the risk of developing hemorrhoids:• straining during bowel movement• sitting for a long period of time on the toilet• chronic diarrhea or constipation• pregnancy• overweight• anal sex• eating low fiber diet, etc   About our pile Shrinker!• its purely herbal without side effects • Comes in different forms;  √ Liquid: to Shrink internal pile   √ powdery: to shrink external pile.

"800 Women Die Everyday During Childbirth In Nigeria - Expert - Health - Nairaland";"frankiekinase";"A Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist and the Coordinator of Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON), Cross River State branch, Prof. Mabel Ekott, has stated that eight hundred (800) women die every day during childbirth in Nigeria - with religion contributing its quota.Ekott who stated this in a workshop organised in Calabar on Wednesday, November 27, 2019, by SOGON with the theme 'Partnership with the Church for improved maternal newborn health', added that the death toll amasses to forty-seven thousand (47,000) every year. She said the workshop is meant to educate Church Leaders on the need of ensuring their pregnant women deliver in hospitals. ""The recent survey shows that 800 women die everyday and 47,000 die annually during child birth in Nigeria. Nigeria leads the world in maternal death with a total of 2.6 million. That's a lot and we are trying our best to ensure that number reduce drastically"", Ekott said.She said that Prayer Houses contribute the highest rate, adding that most of these deaths could be prevented if the women could get to the hospital and receive care from trained healthcare personnel (who are; Doctors and Nurse Midwest, CHEWS).Stressing on the partnership with religious leaders, Ekott said, ""We also know that religious leaders have a lot of influence on the congratulation and almost 80% of us go to church and listen to what the pastor say. We listen to their advise and wise counsel - so we felt it wise to bring the church leaders together from different churches in Calabar and present the date to them. Tell them the care a pregnant woman should receive, tell them the care a newborn baby should receive, tell them about where women lose their lives and that of their babies and ways to prevent them.""We want to collaborate with them, we want to forge a partnership so that they can track every woman (especially the pregnant ones) in their congregation. They should monitor and ensure that the woman gets to hospital and deliver safely and the baby is well cared for"".Speaking also, the Permanent Secretary, Cross River State Ministry of Health, Dr. Joseph Bassey, ably represented Dr. I. E. Esien, said SOGON is taking on a big responsibility in Cross River State which is well appreciated by the Government. ""When we go to church, we should respect the church protocols and when we come to the hospital, we should also respect the hospital's protocols. We appeal that we should corporate in the appropriate way to end maternal death"", he added.A renowned clergyman, Rev. (Dr.) Fubara Manuel of Revelation Ministries, Calabar, advised pastors and ministers that ""it is better to spend church money on our pregnant women than buying expensive caskets. ""Let us stop raring the dogs and forgetting to do the right thing. For caesarean section (C-S) that many forbids: is there anything wrong with opening up a woman? When you say thus saith the Lord and a woman dies, you are a fake pastor"", he added.SOURCE & FULL STORY AT: https://paradisenews.ng/45417/800-women-die-everyday-childbirth-nigeria-prof-ekottPlease, stop going to Prayer Houses, churches to deliver - go to the Hospital, for it is the best place to give birth.";" 202 ";"frankiekinase"

"How To Use An Alum Block - Health - Nairaland";"inyangprincew";"Alum blocks are made of natural potassium alum, a material found on rocks in areas of weather and oxidation which has antiseptic and astringent qualities. Alum blocks are used by many for healing minor nicks and cuts from shaving. Another popular use is as an aftershave treatment. It can help fight razor burn, improve skin tone, prevent ache, and kill germs. Alum blocks are typically small, rock like blocks which look clear to milky. They can last for up to two years, even with daily use.Using an Alum Block as an Aftershave Treatment123456 Method 1 of 2:Using an Alum Block as an Aftershave TreatmentPurchase an alum block. Alum blocks are becoming more common in the US. You can now find them at many drugstores and beauty supply stores. If you're not sure where to look, ask an employee. [1]You can also purchase an alum block online. Typically, they cost around $20. Many people consider this a good investment, as an alum block can last for years.Make sure to purchase a block that is pure alum. You do not want additional ingredients.Wet face with cold water. After you shave, you need to prepare to use the alum block. This means getting your face (or legs) wet. Splashing your face with cold water helps close pores and allows the block to easily glide over your face.Alum blocks are most effective as a post-wet shave product.Make sure to thoroughly rinse all of the soap or shaving cream from your face.Wet the alum block in cold water. This will further make it easier for the block to glide over your face. Simply run the stone back and forth under the faucet. Make sure the entire surface is wet. [2]Some people like to soak the alum block in ice water before use. Beware: this can increase the tingling feeling you will feel during use.Glide alum block across face. Rub the block onto the areas of your skin that you’ve shaved. You can also apply the block to other areas of your face or body. Remember, an alum block is known for its astringent qualities. [3]You can expect to feel a little bit of tightness and perhaps some tingling. Don't worry, this is normal.While most people just use alum block on the face, you can apply it elsewhere on your body. For example, you could rub it on your legs after shaving.Evaluate your shave. If you’re new to shaving the block can be a good indicator of areas where you might want to improve your shaving technique. The alum block has a tingling or stinging feeling so areas where the stinging are high usually indicates that too much pressure is being applied in that area with the blade. Take care to be more gentle on those areas next time.[4]Rinse off with cold water and pat face dry with towel.Some people prefer to skip the rinse and just leave the alum on the face. You'll continue to feel the tightness for a few hours, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable.Dry your alum block. It is essential that you allow your alum block to dry completely before putting it away. Your block won't be effective anymore if you put it away wet.[5]It can take several hours for your block to dry. Try leaving it on the counter to air dry while you are at work.123 Method 2 of 2:Finding Other Uses for an Alum BlockUse an alum block to heal a small cut. Wet the area of the cut with cold water. This will wash the blood away from the cut. Typically, an alum block is used to help heal a small nick that results from shaving. Wetting the area can also help you remove shaving cream residue. [6]Alum blocks can also be used for other small cuts. It is safe enough to use on children.If your child suffers a minor cut, you can apply the alum cut to that area, the same way you would use it on the face.Don't forget to dab the alum block in cold water before use.Apply the block to the area of the cut. Apply the block with light pressure and hold for for 20 – 30 seconds or until bleeding stops. You might experience a slight sting at first but that’s the indication that your cut is being sealed. The alum block acts as a coagulant to stop bleeding. [7]Remove the alum block from the skin if the tingling begins to feel too intense or uncomfortable.Wash face (or other body part) with cold water to close pores and wash away any residue from the alum block.Don't forget to let your block dry before putting it away.Try alum deodorant. Some people use alum as an alternative to typical deodorants. This might be a good alternative if you are looking to avoid spraying or rubbing chemicals on your body.[8]Talk to your doctor before trying an alum (or ""crystal"" antiperspirant. Some health care providers feel that it might be linked to diseases such as breast cancer. While the research is inconclusive, it is important to be aware of this possibility.";" 111 ";"inyangprincew"

"Tyler Robinson Foundation — Robinson's Battle With Cancer - Health - Nairaland";"TwistedInsane";"The Tyler Robinson Foundation begins with the story of Tyler — one of many heroes who chose not to let his prognosis dictate his outlook on life. Tyler was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of cancer, at the age of 16.  In the following year leading up to his passing, he was able to touch countless lives. Those who knew Tyler were inspired by his courage, and his insistence on enjoying life and spreading happiness despite the physical and emotional strain of living with cancer. Determined to continue Tyler’s legacy of creating something positive despite the odds, his family and members of the band Imagine Dragons, who had grown close to Tyler, came together to create the Tyler Robinson Foundation. Below is Tyler’s own story, penned just a few months before his passing. Some people say that Tyler lost his battle with cancer, but we couldn’t disagree more. The real battle is not whether you live or die, but how you respond to the challenge.'My name is Tyler Robinson and I would like to tell you my story.''When I was 11-years old I got a staph infection in my leg that went septic – the infection spread throughout my body and my organs began to shut down. I spent two weeks in intensive care at Primary Children’s Hospital on a respirator and had seven operations on my leg. I was fighting for my life and many people thought that I wouldn’t make it – but I fought hard and after five weeks in the hospital and five months on antibiotics – I was cured.''Last year, when I was 16 years old, I noticed I had a lump in my groin. I had been working out so I just thought I pulled my muscle; but it kept getting bigger. I finally told my mom about it and she took me to the doctor. After the biopsy I learned that I had a cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma. I was told that I had a racquetball-sized tumor near my bladder and that it had spread to my lymph nodes and throughout my body. After a spinal tap they told my parents that my bone marrow was 95% full of cancer. My parents didn’t tell me that it was stage 4 because they didn’t want to discourage me. It seemed surreal at first, but I was OK with it. Then I went to meet with the doctors and they told me what I was facing. I needed to have 20 rounds of chemotherapy and it would take a whole year. I would also need an operation and six weeks of radiation. I would miss my junior year at Brighton High and some of my senior year. I remember going home and feeling so mad and depressed. I told my mom that I didn’t want to go through it – not a whole year of it.''Our local church leader came over that night and counseled with me. He told me that people who go through hard things either become bitter and angry, or they learn from it and become stronger. He told me that I had a choice to make. From that night on, I chose to be the bigger man.''In February I had my first set of scans and tests to check on my progress. My doctor came into the room and told us that everyone was amazed that my tumor was gone and I wouldn’t need an operation. I still needed to go through six weeks of radiation and to continue chemotherapy until the fall. In June the tests showed that my bone marrow was completely clear of cancer. I am now officially cancer free and I will be done with my treatments next month.''This year I’ve learned to be patient and no matter how bad I felt, I pushed through the pain. I found that there is no use complaining or feeling sorry for myself – it doesn’t help anything. Always try to stay positive and have faith.'Tyler’s cancer unexpectedly returned just after writing his story and he passed only a few months later. But his optimism and zest for life stayed with him to the end. He taught those who know and love him the power of positivity and its ability to extinguish darkness even in the face of adversity.This foundation wishes to honor his example by reaching out to lift up other children with cancer and the families who support them.Tyler loved music, which became the catalyst for his relationship with the band Imagine Dragons. One of his favorite lyrics during the time he was battling cancer comes from the song “It’s Time,” which says 'the road to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell'. When the band heard about this, they dedicated the song to him at a show – this was the beginning of a long friendship.";" 59 ";"TwistedInsane"

"6 Reasons To Scrape Your Tongue - Health - Nairaland";"Dentalgist";"Your dentist harps on brushing and flossing but has s/he ever mentioned tongue scraping? Tongue scraping is the unsung hero of dental health. An unscraped tongue is unhygienic, smelly, and bad for the rest of the body.If you’re not tongue scraping, the good news is this: it’s incredibly simple and takes seconds to do.Here are six great reasons to tongue scrape:1. Enhance the flavors of your food.Tongue scraping enhances your taste buds and the flavors you experience by removing the gunk that builds up on your tongue. When your tongue is coated in this buildup, your taste buds aren’t fully exposed and cannot completely experience the wonderful flavors in your food.2. Improve heart health.Poor dental hygiene is linked to cardiovascular disease as well as diabetes and infertility. You might think, “I have great dental hygiene!” But if you’re not tongue scraping, that’s an awfully large surface in the mouth to leave uncleaned.3. Prevent cavities.By cleaning your tongue – especially the back part – you remove bacteria and toxins responsible for plaque. This translates into less plaque buildup on your teeth, which prevents against tooth decay, cavities and gum disease.4. Get rid of bad breath.Some studies estimate that 80 to 95% of bad breath comes from the buildup of food, bacteria, fungi, and dead cells at the back of the tongue. The front of your tongue might look pink and healthy, but stick your tongue out in front of a mirror and examine it way in the back. You’ll probably see white, yellow, or even brown buildup way back there if you aren’t tongue scraping — and people can smell it (not to mention see it when you laugh out loud).5. Boost your immune system.Scraping your tongue will prevent toxins from getting reabsorbed by your body. Tongue scraping is especially crucial while you’re sick since a lot of gunk from coughing, sneezing, or sucking on cough drops or other medicines can build up on the back of the tongue.6. Improve your digestive healthTongue scraping and a clean tongue both promote saliva production, which helps with your digestion.Bonus Reason #7: It’s dead simple.Tongue scraping takes seconds. Once you see all the gunk that comes off your tongue, you’ll never go back!https://askthedentist.com/tongue-scraping-6-reasons/";" 138 ";"Dentalgist"

We have Cameroonians as refugees in over five local government areas of the State. We need to work extra hard with a view to reducing the prevalent rates.

"How Long Does It Take For Chronic Prostatitis To Cure? - Health - Nairaland";"sunnieyong";"Chronic prostatitis describes chronic inflammation from the prostate a result of many reasons and is regarded as the common condition in urology. Prostatitis is recognised as chronic if it lasts for more than three months. Chronic prostatitis consists of chronic bacterial prostatitis and non-bacterial prostatitis.The clinical symptoms of chronic prostatitis tend to be:1. Discomfort. Soreness is principally demonstrated in the prostate as the center of radiation throughout the tissues discomfort, typical in scrotum, testis, abdomen, perineum, lumbosacral, medial femur and other aspects of the anguish, swelling or distress.2. Unnatural urination. It is characterized by consistent urination, urgency, discomfort, burning urethra, residual urine drip, as well as white secretions coming from the urethra when getting up every morning, urine or even stool.3. Psychiatric and neurological indicators. It is actually observed as wooziness, tinnitus, insomnia, dreaming, anxiousness and depressive disorders, and even impotence problems, rapid ejaculation, spermatorrhea, and so on.Thus, how long can chronic prostatitis always be remedied?This really is a tough question to resolve. Because of the special anatomical structure of the prostate, it is difficult for the general antibiotics to diffuse into the prostate lipid, and reach the effective concentration in the prostate, so the curative effect is not good.At the same time, simply because the prostate can be a chronic disease as well as the etiology is not yet distinct, it is not easy to attain a beneficial solution, resulting in a lengthy course of treatment method.For chronic prostatitis, anti-inflammatory drugs and warm sitz baths (usually sitting in two to three inches of warm water) can be used in life. This is the most conservative treatment for chronic prostatitis.Additionally there is a herbal remedies therapies for chronic prostatitis is really practical. That's Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill. It has the main functions of clearing heat and detoxification, promoting blood circulation, promoting Qi and relieving pain, anti-proliferation, anti-fibrosis, anti-calcification, sterilization, anti-inflammation, and detumescence. Under strict dietary control, Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill can kill all kinds of bacteria and viruses causing male urogenital diseases, as well as mycoplasma and chlamydia, depending on its broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties for three months.In short, the occurrence of chronic prostatitis is definitely influenced by a lot of factors.

"Ovarian Cyst And Pregnancy: Meaning, Causes, Symptoms And Effect In Pregnant Wom - Health - Nairaland";"uchenna028";"https://www.geneith.com/2019/12/ovarian-cyst-and-pregnancy-meaning.htmlEvery pregnant woman should have an ovarian cyst which is known as corpus luteum (cyst of pregnancy). It is this cyst that produces the hormone Progesterone. This hormone prevents miscarriage as it thickens the walls of the uterus in preparation to hold the fertilized egg. Hence, without the corpus luteum, most pregnancies would end in miscarriages.    Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs or pockets in an ovary and majority of them may also disappear without treatment within few months. The ones that are usually associated with the hormonal imbalance during menstrual cycle are known as functional cysts and they occur in about one out of four women. Majority of ovarian cysts won’t affect your pregnancy at all.For instance, when it comes to a corpus luteum cyst, chances are it will go away on its own.Other types of cysts can continue to grow during pregnancy, and in some cases cause pain, but even in those cases, such cysts usually don’t cause problems for the pregnancy. Other types of ovarian cysts may include:· Dermoid cysts. These can contain tissue, such as hair, skin or teeth, because they form from embryonic cells. They're rarely cancerous.· Cystadenomas. These develop on the surface of an ovary and might be filled with a watery or a mucous material.· Endometriomas. These develop as a result of a condition in which uterine endometrial cells grow outside your uterus. Some of the tissue can attach to your ovary and form a growth.To be sure that an ovarian cyst doesn’t impact your pregnancy, and/or to monitor any existing cysts, your practitioner will schedule regular ultrasounds to keep an eye on your ovaries.An ovarian cyst ultrasound will track the size and condition of any cyst to make sure it doesn’t grow or change in any way that may make it worrisome. Some women develop less common types of cysts that a doctor finds during a pelvic exam. Cystic ovarian masses that develop after menopause might be cancerous (malignant). That's why it's important to have regular pelvic exams.Ovarian cysts usually does not produce any symptoms, however, some of the under listed symptoms may occur especially with large or ruptured cyst.   · Lower abdominal or pelvic pain. This may be intermittent, or can be severe, sudden, and sharp.· Irregular menstrual periods· Chronic pelvic pain or low back pain throughout the menstrual cycle· Pain or pressure with urination or bowel movementSome complications associated with ovarian cysts that are not common include:· Ovarian torsion. Cysts that enlarge can cause the ovary to move, increasing the chance of painful twisting of your ovary (ovarian torsion). Symptoms can include an abrupt onset of severe pelvic pain, nausea and vomiting. Ovarian torsion can also decrease or stop blood flow to the ovaries.· Rupture. A cyst that ruptures can cause severe pain and internal bleeding. The larger the cyst, the greater the risk of rupture. Vigorous activity that affects the pelvis, such as vaginal intercourse, also increases the risk.Although there's no way to prevent ovarian cysts, regular pelvic examinations help ensure that changes in your ovaries are diagnosed as early as possible as this will ensure that the cyst does not affect the pregnancy negatively.https://www.geneith.com/2019/12/ovarian-cyst-and-pregnancy-meaning.html";" 73 ";"uchenna028"

"Why You Should You Try Cupping Therapy For Pain, Immunity & Digestion - Health - Nairaland";"Northtoronto";"The ancient Chinese technique, cupping therapy is an alternative medical practice that typically involves placing the cups on the skin that creates suction, which further facilitates healing with blood flow.

Concentrated medical grade oxygen is delivered to the user through a mask or nasal intubation. The O2 machine delivers oxygen in the form of continuous flow or pulse dose. At each inhalation, the pulse dose oxygen generator will release oxygen in a dose or burst manner. It is based on the rate of breathing and the amount of oxygen taken. This ensures that the right amount of oxygen is delivered according to different periods of activity (sleep, rest or daily work).

"Magun Na Scam. Demystifying Penis Captivus - Health - Nairaland";"Noblejay7";"MAGUN Na SCAMMen read this so you will know its not witchcraft WHEN IT happen TO YOU The Penis Captivus:Before you start blaming village people please read on. Knowledge is Power-It's when a male and a female get stuck. This is a very, very rare phenomenon. This has nothing to do with witchcraft, neither spells thrown, nor infidelity.What's the captivus penis?During love, suddenly we realize that we're stuck. The penis is in the vagina, and it is impossible to get it out. At First, we wait a little, and it stays stuck. Stuck penis doesn't make everyone laugh! Medical students tell each other hunting stories, so are the samu employees. And we can all laugh. But when it happens to you, at the moment, you don't find it especially fun. An emergency doctor told me: "" a lady called me and said she had a very stomach pain. In fact, when I arrived, she was stuck with her lover... and they were both very shy, even if they were trying to act like it was a ordinary situation. Actually, I've only seen this twice in my career. It's still relatively rare... ""Penis Penis, why does the penis stay blocked?It's the vagina that holds the penis. The muscles of the perineum, located around the vagina, contract very strong, completely involuntary. The girl can't do it, it's like an unusual reflex, but uncontrollable. She can't relax those muscles. It's a kind of muscle spasms around the vagina. Stuck penis, the gesture that unstick? Before calling the doctor, there is a gesture that can unlock the situation. So it's always to try before calling the firefighters, the samu the emergency or the doctor who will take a bite to relax the muscle! Being able to manage yourself in these conditions is rather reassuring. The gesture that unstick is a rectal touch [Stick a dry and sharp finger in the woman's ass]. it's about putting a finger in the girl's butt. Not very glamorous? No, but it causes a relaxation reflex of the muscles of the perineum.Another solution: if you have a sleeping pill, you have to make it with the swallow the woman. Even Valium 10 mg is enough. She's dozes and all her muscles are releasing. Man can then withdraw easily.Here is in these few lines, a process that prevents any panic in the case of case. I'll be told that we're in Africa and it's another reality, right? The phenomenon is explained and it is necessary before any other reasons, to try what is possible here. Good reading and good meditation to all. Pleasant new month to you";" 187 ";"Noblejay7"
